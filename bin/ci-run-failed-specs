${BLUE}Failed Spec Runner${NC}

Run only the specific RSpec examples that failed in CI.

${YELLOW}Usage:${NC}
  bin/ci-run-failed-specs [OPTIONS] [SPEC_PATHS...]
  pbpaste | bin/ci-run-failed-specs
  bin/ci-run-failed-specs < failures.txt

${YELLOW}Options:${NC}
  --help, -h    Show this help message

${YELLOW}Examples:${NC}
  # Pass spec paths directly
  bin/ci-run-failed-specs './spec/system/integration_spec.rb[1:1:1:1]'

  # Copy from GitHub Actions, paste to run
  pbpaste | bin/ci-run-failed-specs

  # From file
  bin/ci-run-failed-specs < failures.txt

  # Multiple specs
  bin/ci-run-failed-specs './spec/system/integration_spec.rb[1:1:1:1]' './spec/system/integration_spec.rb[10:1]'

${YELLOW}Features:${NC}
  - Parses RSpec failure output automatically
  - Extracts spec paths from "rspec ./spec/..." lines
  - Deduplicates specs
  - Auto-detects working directory (runs from spec/dummy when needed)
  - Confirms before running

${YELLOW}Workflow:${NC}
  1. Go to failed job on GitHub Actions
  2. Copy the "Failed examples:" section
  3. Run: pbpaste | bin/ci-run-failed-specs
  4. Tests run only for those specific failures

${YELLOW}Related Tools:${NC}
  bin/ci-rerun-failures    Auto-detect and re-run failed CI jobs
  bin/ci-local             Smart test detection based on code changes
