# Deprecated: Legacy Code-Splitting Guide

This page documents an old `react-loadable` approach and is kept only for backward URL compatibility.

Use this guide instead:

- [SSR with code-splitting using Loadable Components](./code-splitting-loadable-components.md)

## Why this page is deprecated

The old approach relied on deprecated tooling and custom SSR orchestration that is no longer recommended for React on Rails Pro.

If you reached this page from old links, update those references to:

- `react_on_rails_pro/docs/code-splitting-loadable-components.md`
