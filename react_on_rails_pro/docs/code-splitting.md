# Deprecated: Legacy Code-Splitting Guide

This page documents an old `react-loadable` approach and is kept only for backward URL compatibility.

**Use this guide instead:** [SSR with code-splitting using Loadable Components](./code-splitting-loadable-components.md)

The old approach relied on deprecated tooling and custom SSR orchestration that is no longer recommended.

If you reached this page from old links, update those references to:

- `react_on_rails_pro/docs/code-splitting-loadable-components.md`
