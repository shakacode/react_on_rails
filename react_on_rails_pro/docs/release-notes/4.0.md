# 4.0 Release Notes

## 🚀 Major New Features

### React Server Components (RSC) - Full Production Support

React on Rails Pro now provides comprehensive support for React Server Components, enabling you to build the next generation of React applications:

- **Full RSC Integration**: Seamlessly use React Server Components in your Rails apps with zero configuration
- **Bundle Optimization**: Automatic client/server code splitting that significantly reduces client-side JavaScript
- **Server-Side Data Fetching**: Direct access to databases, APIs, and server resources from React components
- **Progressive Hydration**: Client components hydrate independently for optimal performance
- **RSC Payload Streaming**: Efficient streaming of component data with embedded payloads
- **Compatible with React Router**: [Use React Router with RSC](../react-server-components/inside-client-components.md)

See our [complete RSC tutorial](../react-server-components/tutorial.md) to get started.

### Advanced Streaming Server Rendering

Building on React 19's streaming capabilities, React on Rails Pro delivers:

- **Progressive HTML Streaming**: Send page content as it becomes available
- **Suspense Boundary Support**: Handle async components with proper loading states
- **Selective Hydration**: Components become interactive as soon as they're ready
- **Error Boundary Handling**: Graceful error handling during streaming with configurable error raising
- **Async Console Log Replay**: Debug async server-side rendering with client-side console output

### Enhanced Error Reporting & Tracing

Completely redesigned error reporting system with:

- **Custom Integration Support**: Integrate with any error reporting service (Sentry, Honeybadger, or custom)
- **Sentry SDK v8 Support**: Latest Sentry integration with improved performance
- **Flexible Configuration**: Configure error reporting according to your preferences
- **Enhanced Tracing**: Better visibility into rendering performance and issues

## Performance Improvements

### Node Renderer Architecture

- **Fastify 5 Integration**: Upgraded from Express to Fastify for significantly better performance
- **HTTP/2 Cleartext Communication**: Rails communicates with Node renderer over HTTP/2 instead of HTTP/1.1
- **HTTPX Client**: Replaced Net::HTTP with HTTPX for improved connection handling
- **Pino Logging**: Switched from Winston to Pino for better performance and Fastify compatibility

These changes provide:

- Better performance when Node renderer is deployed on the same machine as Rails
- Significantly improved performance when deployed in separate workloads
- Enhanced connection reuse and multiplexing capabilities
- Better error handling and process management

### Changes Specific For RSC Rendering Optimization

- **Cross-Bundle Communication**: Components can now interact seamlessly across different bundles using the new `runOnOtherBundle` function, enabling advanced composition and modularization patterns.
- **Single-Pass Server Component Rendering**: Server components are rendered just once within the RSC bundle, then efficiently reused for both SSR and client hydration—eliminating redundant work and improving performance.
- **Reduced HTTP Requests**: RSC payloads are now embedded directly into the initial HTML response. No need to make an additional request to fetch the RSC payload.
- **Protocol v2.0 – Unified Bundle Management**: The new protocol allows simultaneous upload of both server and RSC bundles in a single request, supporting multiple bundle uploads and providing robust, flexible bundle management for complex applications.

## Breaking Changes

### Configuration Updates

- **Sentry/Honeybadger**: Remove old configuration options starting with `sentry` or `honeybadger`
- **Timer Polyfills**: `includeTimerPolyfills` is renamed to `stubTimers`
- **Environment Variables**: `RENDERER_STUB_TIMERS` instead of `INCLUDE_TIMER_POLYFILLS`
- **Error Reporting**: Follow the [Error Reporting and Tracing](../node-renderer/error-reporting-and-tracing.md) documentation for new setup

### Dependency Requirements

- **Ruby 3+**: Dropped support for Ruby 2.7 (EOL)
- **React on Rails 15+**: Required for RSC and streaming features
- **Node 20+**: Strongly recommended (older versions require specific package.json resolutions)

### Package.json Resolutions (for Node < 20)

If using older Node versions, add to your `package.json`:

```json
"resolutions": {
  "@fastify/formbody": "^7.4.0",
  "@fastify/multipart": "^8.3.1",
  "fastify": "^4.29.0"
}
```
