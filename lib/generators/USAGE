Description:

The react_on_rails:install generator integrates webpack with rails with ease. You
can pass the redux option if you'd like to have redux setup for you automatically.
The team at ShakaCode prefers to have all client side development files in a top-
-level directory called `/client`. This more cleanly separates the front-end code
from the back-end code.
To change back to the default, change the default source_path in config/webpacker
.yml to `app/javascript` and run `mv client/app app/javascript`.

* Redux

    Passing the --redux generator option causes the generated Hello World example
    to integrate the Redux state container framework. The necessary node modules
    will be automatically included for you.

*******************************************************************************

After running the generator, you will want to:

    bundle && yarn

Then you may run

    foreman start -f Procfile.dev
