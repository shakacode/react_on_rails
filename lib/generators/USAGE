Description:

The react_on_rails:install generator integrates webpack with rails with ease. You
can pass the redux option if you'd like to have redux setup for you automatically.

* Redux

    Passing the --redux generator option causes the generated Hello World example
    to integrate the Redux state container framework. The necessary node modules
    will be automatically included for you.

* Node

    Passing the --node generator option sets up the necessary files for node to render the react_components.

*******************************************************************************

After running the generator, you will want to:

    bundle && yarn

Then you may run

    foreman start -f Procfile.dev

*******************************************************************************

* Start

		Running the start generator will reset the client folder to client/app erasing the HelloWorld folder. Which will create the build path for the component and container generators and the file insertions.

* Component #{name}

		The component generator will generate an initial components folder inside of client/app with the #{name} component folder inside, passing the #{name} to the registration file and generating the rails views and routes.

* Container #{name}

		Creates an initial containers folder inside of the app folder. Also, creates a #{name} folder inside of containers with the necessary smart container files, passing the #{name} to the registration file and generating the rails views and routes.
