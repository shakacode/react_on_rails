Description:

The react_on_rails:install generator integrates webpack with rails with ease. You
can pass the redux option if you'd like to have redux setup for you automatically.

* Redux

    Passing the --redux generator option causes the generated Hello World example
    to integrate the Redux state container framework. The necessary node modules
    will be automatically included for you.

*******************************************************************************

After running the generator, you will want to:

    bundle && yarn

Then you may run

    foreman start -f Procfile.dev
