Description:

The react_on_rails:install generator integrates a React frontend, including SSR, with Rails.

* Redux (Optional)

    Passing the --redux generator option causes the generated Hello World example
    to integrate the Redux state container framework. The necessary node modules
    will be automatically included for you.

*******************************************************************************

After running the generator, you will want to:

    bundle && npm install     # or yarn install, or pnpm install

Then you may run

    ./bin/dev
