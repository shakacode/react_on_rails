# Service Dependencies Configuration
#
# This file defines external services that must be running before bin/dev starts.
# Copy this file to .dev-services.yml and customize for your application.
#
# bin/dev will check each service before starting the development server.
# If any service is not running, it will display helpful error messages with
# instructions on how to start the service.
#
# ⚠️  SECURITY WARNING:
# Commands in this file are executed during bin/dev startup. Only add commands
# from trusted sources. This file should not be committed if it contains
# sensitive information or custom paths specific to your machine. Consider
# adding .dev-services.yml to .gitignore if it contains machine-specific config.
#
# Security best practices:
# - Commands are executed without shell expansion (shell metacharacters won't work)
# - Use simple, single commands (e.g., "redis-cli ping", "pg_isready")
# - Do NOT use shell features: &&, ||, |, $, ;, backticks, etc. will fail
# - Only include services you trust
# - Keep commands simple and focused on service health checks
# - Consider adding .dev-services.yml to .gitignore (commit .example instead)
