# Note, hot and live reloading don't work with the default generator setup on
# top of the rails/webpacker Webpack config with server rendering.
# If you have server rendering enabled (prerender is true), you either need to
# a. Skip using the webpack-dev-server. bin/webpack --watch is typically
     fast enough.
# b. See the React on Rails README for a link to documentation for how to setup
#    SSR with HMR and React hot loading
# Otherwise, you will have an error. If you want HMR and Server Rendering, see
# the example in the https://github.com/shakacode/react-webpack-rails-tutorial

web: rails s -p 3000

# Next line runs the webpack-dev-server
# You can edit config/webpacker.yml to set HMR to true to see hot reloading.
