# Procfile for development using HMR

web: rails s -p 3000

# Note, hot and live reloading don't work with the default generator setup on
# top of the rails/webpacker Webpack config with server rendering.
# If you have server rendering enabled (prerender is true), you either need to
# a. Ensure that you have dev_server.hmr and dev_server.inline BOTH set to false,
#    and you have this option in your config/initializers/react_on_rails.rb:
#      config.same_bundle_for_client_and_server = true
#    If you have either config/webpacker.yml option set to true, you'll see errors like
#    "ReferenceError: window is not defined" (if hmr is true)
#    "TypeError: Cannot read property 'prototype' of undefined" (if inline is true)
# b. Skip using the webpack-dev-server. bin/webpack --watch is typically
     fast enough.
# c. See the React on Rails README for a link to documentation for how to setup
#    SSR with HMR and React hot loading using the webpack-dev-server only for the
#    client bundles and a static file for the server bundle.

# Run the webpack-dev-server for client and maybe server files
webpack-dev-server: bin/webpack-dev-server

# Keep the JS fresh for server rendering. Remove if not server rendering.
# Especially if you have not configured generation of a server bundle without a hash.
# as that will conflict with the manifest created by the bin/webpack-dev-server
# rails-server-assets: SERVER_BUNDLE_ONLY=yes bin/webpack --watch
