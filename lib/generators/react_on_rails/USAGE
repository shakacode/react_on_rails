Description:
    The `react_on_rails:doctor` generator diagnoses your React on Rails setup
    and identifies potential configuration issues. It performs comprehensive
    checks on your environment, dependencies, and configuration files.

    This command is especially useful for:
    • Troubleshooting setup issues
    • Verifying installation after running react_on_rails:install
    • Ensuring compatibility after upgrades
    • Getting help with configuration problems

Example:
    # Basic diagnosis
    rails generate react_on_rails:doctor

    # Verbose output showing all checks
    rails generate react_on_rails:doctor --verbose

    # Show help
    rails generate react_on_rails:doctor --help

Checks performed:
    Environment Prerequisites:
    • Node.js installation and version compatibility
    • JavaScript package manager availability (npm, yarn, pnpm, bun)
    • Git working directory status

    React on Rails Packages:
    • React on Rails gem installation
    • react-on-rails NPM package installation
    • Version synchronization between gem and NPM package
    • Shakapacker configuration and installation

    Dependencies:
    • React and React DOM installation
    • Babel preset configuration
    • Required development dependencies

    Rails Integration:
    • React on Rails initializer configuration
    • Route and controller setup (Hello World example)
    • View helper integration

    Webpack Configuration:
    • Webpack config file existence and structure
    • React on Rails compatibility checks
    • Environment-specific configuration validation

    Development Environment:
    • JavaScript bundle files
    • Procfile.dev for development workflow
    • .gitignore configuration for generated files

Options:
    --verbose, -v: Show detailed output for all checks, including successful ones
    --fix, -f:     Attempt to fix simple issues automatically (planned feature)

Exit codes:
    0: All checks passed or only warnings found
    1: Critical errors found that prevent React on Rails from working
