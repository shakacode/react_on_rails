# News
* ShakaCode now maintains the official successor to `rails/webpacker`, [`shakapacker`](https://github.com/shakacode/shakapacker).
* Project is updated to support Rails 7!

-----

*These are the docs for React on Rails 13. To see the older docs: [v12](https://github.com/shakacode/react_on_rails/tree/12.6.0) and [v11](https://github.com/shakacode/react_on_rails/tree/11.3.0).*

#### About
React on Rails integrates Rails with (server rendering of) Facebook's [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) front-end framework.

This project is maintained by the software consulting firm [ShakaCode](https://www.shakacode.com). We focus on Ruby on Rails applications with React front-ends, often using TypeScript or ReScript (ReasonML). We also build React Native apps and Gatsby sites. See [our recent work](https://www.shakacode.com/recent-work) for examples of what we do. ShakaCode.com (HiChee.com) is [hiring developers that like working on open-source](https://www.shakacode.com/career/).

Are you interested in optimizing your webpack setup for React on Rails including code
splitting with [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router#readme) and
 [loadable-components](https://loadable-components.com/) with server-side rendering for SEO and hot-reloading for developers?
We did this for Popmenu, [lowering Heroku costs 20-25% while getting a 73% decrease in average response times](https://www.shakacode.com/recent-work/popmenu/). Several years later, Popmenu is serving millions of SSR requests per day React on Rails.

Check out [React on Rails Pro](https://www.shakacode.com/react-on-rails-pro/). For more information, feel free to contact Justin Gordon, [justin@shakacode.com](mailto:justin@shakacode.com), maintainer of React on Rails.

# Documentation

See the documentation at **[shakacode.com/react-on-rails/docs](https://www.shakacode.com/react-on-rails/docs/)**.

## Project Objective

To provide a high performance framework for integrating Ruby on Rails with React via the [**Webpacker**](https://github.com/rails/webpacker) gem, especially regarding React Server-Side Rendering for better SEO and improved performance.

## Features and Why React on Rails?

Given that `rails/webpacker` gem already provides basic React integration, why would you use "React on Rails"?

1. Easy passing of props directly from your Rails view to your React components rather than having your Rails view load and then make a separate request to your API.
1. Tight integration with [rails/webpacker](https://github.com/rails/webpacker).
1. Server-Side Rendering (SSR), often used for SEO crawler indexing and UX performance, is not offered by `rails/webpacker`.
1. [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) and [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router#readme) integration with server-side-rendering.
1. [Internationalization (I18n) and (localization)](https://www.shakacode.com/react-on-rails/docs/guides/i18n)
1. A supportive community. This [web search shows how live public sites are using React on Rails](https://publicwww.com/websites/%22react-on-rails%22++-undeveloped.com+depth%3Aall/).
1. [Reason ML Support](https://github.com/shakacode/reason-react-on-rails-example).

See [Rails/Webpacker React Integration Options](https://www.shakacode.com/react-on-rails/docs/guides/rails-webpacker-react-integration-options) for comparisons to other gems.

## Online demo
* See the [react-webpack-rails-tutorial](https://github.com/shakacode/react-webpack-rails-tutorial) for an example of a live implementation and code.
* A deployed version of the project `spec/dummy` which demonstrates several uses of `react_on_rails` is available on heroku [through this link](https://ror-spec-dummy.herokuapp.com/)
