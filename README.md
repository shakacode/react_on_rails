And based on the work of the [react-rails gem](https://github.com/reactjs/react-rails)

# Key Info
Currently being implemented in 3 production projects (not yet live).

1. https://github.com/justin808/react-webpack-rails-tutorial/ See https://github.com/shakacode/react-webpack-rails-tutorial/pull/84 for how we integrated it!

3. http://forum.railsonmaui.com
4. Lots of work to do in terms of docs, tests
5. If this project is interesting to you, email me at justin@shakacode.com. We're looking for great
developers that want to work with Rails + React with a distributed, worldwide team.


# Try it out!
Contributions and pull requests welcome!

1. Setup and run the test app. There's no database.
  ```bash
  cd spec/dummy
  bundle
  npm i
  foreman start
  ```
2. Caching is turned for development mode. Open the console and run `Rails.cache.clear` to clear
  the cache. Note, even if you stop the server, you'll still have the cache entries around.
3. Visit http://localhost:3000
4. Notice that the first time you hit the page, you'll see a message that server is rendering.
   See `spec/dummy/app/views/pages/index.html.erb:17` for the generation of that message.
5. Open up the browser console and see some tracing.
6. Open up the source for the page and see the server rendered code.
7. If you want to turn off server caching, run the server like:
   `export RAILS_USE_CACHE=N && foreman start`
8. If you click back and forth between the about and react page links, you can see the rails console
   log as well as the browser console to see what's going on with regards to server rendering and
   caching.

# Key Tips
1. See sample app in `spec/dummy` for how to set this up.
2. The file used for server rendering is hard coded as `generated/server.js`
   (assets/javascripts/generated/server.js).
3. If you're only doing client rendering, you still *MUST* create an empty version of this file. This
   will soon change so that this is not necessary.
3. The default for rendering right now is `prerender: false`. **NOTE:**  Server side rendering does
   not work for some components, namely react-router, that use an async setup for server rendering.
   You can configure the default for prerender in your config.
4. You can expose either a React component or a function that returns a React component. If you wish to create a React component via a function, rather than simply props, then you need to set the property "generator" on that function to true. When that is done, the function is invoked with a single parameter of "props", and that function should return a React element.

# Example Configuration, config/react_on_rails.rb
```ruby
   ReactOnRails.configure do |config|
     config.bundle_js_file = "app/assets/javascripts/generated/server.js" # This is the default
     config.prerender = true # default is false
   end
```

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'react_on_rails'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install react_on_rails

## Usage

PENDING. See `spec/dummy` for the sample app.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake rspec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
