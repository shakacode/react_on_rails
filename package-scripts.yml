      # They may also be run when publishing or in other cases, so we want to cover all of them.

      # 2. Build the project but ignore TypeScript errors from missing devDependencies;
      # 3. Check if the project is built now;
      # 4. If it failed, print an error message (still follow https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/scripts#best-practices).
