## MIT License for Core React on Rails

This license applies to all files within this repository, with the exception of the code located in the following directories, which are licensed separately under the React on Rails Pro License:

- `lib/react_on_rails/pro/`
- `node_package/src/pro/`

**Important:** The Pro-licensed directories contain code that is included in this package but requires a valid React on Rails Pro subscription to function. Any attempt to circumvent, bypass, modify, or disable the license validation mechanisms is strictly prohibited and constitutes a violation of this license and the React on Rails Pro License.

**Critical:** The MIT-licensed code that imports or interfaces with Pro-licensed modules (including but not limited to clientStartup.ts, serverRenderReactComponent.ts, ReactOnRails.client.ts, and ReactOnRails.node.ts) is protected by this license. Any modification, patching, or circumvention of these interface modules to enable unauthorized access to Pro features is strictly prohibited and constitutes a violation of this license and the React on Rails Pro License.

**Ruby License Validation Protection:** The MIT-licensed Ruby code that performs license validation and generates the `rails_context` (including but not limited to lib/react_on_rails/helper.rb, lib/react_on_rails/utils.rb, and any code that calls `ReactOnRails::Utils.react_on_rails_pro?` or generates the `rorPro` field) is protected by this license. Any modification, patching, or circumvention of these license validation mechanisms to enable unauthorized access to Pro features is strictly prohibited and constitutes a violation of this license and the React on Rails Pro License.
