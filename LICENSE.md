# Licensing

This repository contains code under two different licenses:

- **Core**: MIT License (applies to most files)
- **Pro**: React on Rails Pro License (applies to specific directories)

## License Scope

### MIT Licensed Code

The following directories and all their contents are licensed under the **MIT License** (see full text below):

- `lib/react_on_rails/` (excluding `lib/react_on_rails/pro/`)
- `node_package/src/` (excluding `node_package/src/pro/`)
- `node_package/lib/` (excluding `node_package/lib/pro/`)
- All other directories in this repository not explicitly listed as Pro-licensed

### Pro Licensed Code

The following directories and all their contents are licensed under the **React on Rails Pro License**:

- `lib/react_on_rails/pro/`
- `node_package/src/pro/`
- `node_package/lib/pro/`

See [REACT-ON-RAILS-PRO-LICENSE.md](./REACT-ON-RAILS-PRO-LICENSE.md) for complete Pro license terms.

## React on Rails Pro License

For Pro-licensed code (as defined in the "License Scope" section above), see:
[REACT-ON-RAILS-PRO-LICENSE.md](./REACT-ON-RAILS-PRO-LICENSE.md)

**Key Points:**

- Pro features require a valid React on Rails Pro subscription for production use
- Free use is permitted for educational, personal, and non-production purposes
- Modifying MIT-licensed interface files is permitted under MIT terms
- However, using those modifications to access Pro features without a valid license violates the Pro License

### License Validation Mechanisms

**License validation mechanisms** include but are not limited to:

- Runtime checks for valid Pro subscriptions
- Authentication systems in `lib/react_on_rails/utils.rb` and Pro TypeScript modules
- The `react_on_rails_pro?` method and `rorPro` field generation

While MIT-licensed code may be modified under MIT terms, using such modifications to access Pro features without a valid license violates the React on Rails Pro License.
