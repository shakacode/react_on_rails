We are delighted that you are considering this property for your vacation lodging. We are sure that you would enjoy this lovely vacation home.\nThis property has a vacation rental permit issued by the County of Maui, and is subject to the rules and restrictions imposed by the County for all short term rental homes. Please understand that we would be unable to accept a rental that does not agree to abide by these rules. Note: properties without a short term rental permit are subject to closure by the County.\n1. Neighbors - Please be considerate of our neighbors. Noise carries easily to their homes, particularly in the evening. NO loud music, NO parties, NO amplified sound of any nature at any time. Many neighbors must be up early in the morning to go to work, and it’s important that your use of this property does not impact them in any way.\n2. Quiet Hours - Quiet time is from 9pm to 8am.\n3. Use of the Property - Additional friends/family CANNOT be invited to the property and it cannot be used as a “meeting place”. The property can be used ONLY by the guests listed on the rental agreement. The County law allows us to accommodate a maximum of two guests x the number of bedrooms.\n4. Parking - There is plenty of parking on the property. Vehicles CANNOT be parked on the street at any time. When vehicles are on the street, there is insufficient space for emergency vehicles, fire trucks, the trash truck or neighbors to get down the road.\nAdditional information with respect to care and maintenance of the house will be included in the rental agreement.","amenityIds":[19,10,24,28,34,1,3],"checkIn":8,"checkOut":12,"cleaningFee":null,"deposit":null,"minimumStay":null,"monthlyDiscount":0,"price":null,"weeklyDiscount":0,"propertyType":null,"closeTo":null,"apt":"8872","street":"505 Ekahi Way","zipCode":"96753","urls":[],"newConversationPath":"/conversations/new?listing_id=6546","photos":[{"cloudUrl":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dsm07vjyu/image/upload/ck9lhmsifpmoi8xyep4f.jpg","id":3662,"publicId":"ck9lhmsifpmoi8xyep4f","version":"1494831873","format":"jpg","position":0,"resourceType":"image","width":1024,"height":682,"description":null,"listingId":6546},{"cloudUrl":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dsm07vjyu/image/upload/znmwgsfvibk8xdploxw2.jpg","id":3663,"publicId":"znmwgsfvibk8xdploxw2","version":"1494831874","format":"jpg","position":1,"resourceType":"image","width":1280,"height":694,"description":null,"listingId":6546}],"owner":{"avatarUrl":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dsm07vjyu/image/upload/v1494831730/woqtbsvkbtqycbg12uum.png","coverImageUrl":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dsm07vjyu/image/upload/v1494831731/a3m5txdnjijykdqtpccu.png","id":3916,"username":"michaelfox885","firstName":"michael","lastName":"fox","fullName":"michael fox","aboutMeDetails":"I have been in the Maui condo rental business for over twenty five years and have, over the years sent thousands of happy guests to our condos. We're located in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada (just outside Vancouver). We have been married for thirty eight years and have three children with whom we spent many happy holidays on Maui and continue to do so now as well. At one point we even talked about packing up and moving to Maui but that did not materialize. Our hobbies are cycling (especially around our gorgeous seawall here in Vancouver), walking, yoga, reading and going to the cinema.","createdAt":"2017-05-15T17:00:05.292+10:00","lastSignInAt":"2016-05-24T17:55:19.323+10:00","personalWebsiteUrl":".example.com","twitterUrl":null,"facebookUrl":null,"linkedinUrl":"http://linkedin.com/","vrboUrl":null,"airbnbUrl":null,"fbConnected":false,"url":"/users/michaelfox885"},"systemHouseRules":[],"customHouseRules":[]},"bundle":"listings-show-client-bundle","user":{"avatarUrl":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dsm07vjyu/image/gravatar/d_default_avatar.png/60ffe5c75d594b26bfe72bace107f421.png","coverImageUrl":null,"id":3917,"username":"justingordon951","firstName":"Justin","lastName":"Gordon","fullName":"Justin Gordon","aboutMeDetails":null,"createdAt":"2017-05-15T17:05:31.376+10:00","lastSignInAt":"2017-05-19T16:47:46.141+10:00","personalWebsiteUrl":null,"twitterUrl":null,"facebookUrl":null,"linkedinUrl":null,"vrboUrl":null,"airbnbUrl":null,"fbConnected":false,"url":"/users/justingordon951"}};
