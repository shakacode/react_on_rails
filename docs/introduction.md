# React on Rails

> **Integrate React components seamlessly into your Rails application with server-side rendering, hot reloading, and more.**

React on Rails integrates Rails with React, providing a high-performance framework for server-side rendering (SSR) and seamless component integration via [Shakapacker](https://github.com/shakacode/shakapacker).

## What is React on Rails?

React on Rails bridges the gap between Ruby on Rails and React, allowing you to:

- Render React components directly from Rails views with the `react_component` helper
- Pass props from Rails to React without building a separate API
- Enable server-side rendering for better SEO and initial page load performance
- Use hot module replacement (HMR) for fast development iterations
- Integrate with Redux, React Router, and the modern React ecosystem

Unlike a separate SPA approach, React on Rails lets you leverage Rails conventions while progressively enhancing your UI with React components.

## Why React on Rails?

**Key Benefits:**

1. **No Separate API Required** - Pass data directly from Rails views to React components
2. **Server-Side Rendering** - Built-in SSR support for SEO and performance (not available in Shakapacker alone)
3. **Rails Integration** - Works with Rails conventions, asset pipeline, and existing apps
4. **Modern Tooling** - Full Webpack, HMR, and NPM ecosystem support via Shakapacker
5. **Progressive Enhancement** - Mix Rails views with React components on the same page

## When to Use React on Rails

**Choose React on Rails if:**

- ‚úÖ You have an existing Rails application
- ‚úÖ You want React's component model and ecosystem
- ‚úÖ You need server-side rendering for SEO or performance
- ‚úÖ You want to avoid building and maintaining a separate API
- ‚úÖ You value Rails conventions and want tight integration

**Consider alternatives if:**

- ‚ùå You're building a standalone SPA with a separate API backend

## Core Concepts

Before building features, understand these fundamentals:

- **[How React on Rails Works](./core-concepts/how-react-on-rails-works.md)** - Architecture overview
- **[Auto-Bundling](./core-concepts/auto-bundling-file-system-based-automated-bundle-generation.md)** - Automatic component registration and bundle generation
- **[Client vs Server Rendering](./core-concepts/client-vs-server-rendering.md)** - When to use each
- **[Webpack Configuration](./core-concepts/webpack-configuration.md)** - Customizing your build

## Philosophy

React on Rails follows the **[Rails Doctrine](https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine)** and extends it to modern JavaScript development:

- **Convention over Configuration** - Sensible defaults for JavaScript tooling with Rails
- **Optimize for Programmer Happiness** - Hot reloading, ES6+, CSS modules, NPM ecosystem
- **Value Integrated Systems** - Tight Rails integration beats separate microservices for most apps

Read the full **[React on Rails Doctrine](./misc/doctrine.md)** for our design philosophy.

## System Requirements

- **Rails 7+** (Rails 5.2+ supported)
- **Ruby 3.0+**
- **Node.js 20+**
- **Shakapacker 6+** (7+ recommended for React on Rails v16)
