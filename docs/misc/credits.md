[The Shaka Code team!](http://www.shakacode.com/about/)

The origins of the project began with the need to do a rich JavaScript interface for a ShakaCode's client. The choice to use Webpack and Rails is described in [Fast Rich Client Rails Development With Webpack and the ES6 Transpiler](http://www.railsonmaui.com/blog/2014/10/03/integrating-webpack-and-the-es6-transpiler-into-an-existing-rails-project/).

The gem project started with [Justin Gordon](https://github.com/justin808/) pairing with [Samnang Chhun](https://github.com/samnang) to figure out how to do server rendering with Webpack plus Rails. [Alex Fedoseev](https://github.com/alex35mil) then joined in. [Rob Wise](https://github.com/robwise), [Aaron Van Bokhoven](https://github.com/aaronvb), and [Andy Wang](https://github.com/yorzi) did the bulk of the generators. Many others have [contributed](https://github.com/shakacode/react_on_rails/graphs/contributors).

The gem was initially inspired by the [react-rails gem](https://github.com/reactjs/react-rails).
