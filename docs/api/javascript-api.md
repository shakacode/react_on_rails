# ReactOnRails JavaScript API
## CSRF protection

Rails has built-in protection for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), see [Rails Documentation](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html#cross-site-request-forgery-csrf). To nicely utilize this feature in JavaScript requests, React on Rails provides two helpers that can be used as following for POST, PUT or DELETE requests:

```js
import ReactOnRails from 'react-on-rails';

// reads from DOM csrf token generated by Rails in <%= csrf_meta_tags %>
csrfToken = ReactOnRails.authenticityToken();

// compose Rails specific request header as following { X-CSRF-Token: csrfToken, X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest }
header = ReactOnRails.authenticityHeaders(otherHeader);
```

If you are using [jquery-ujs](https://github.com/rails/jquery-ujs) for AJAX calls, then these helpers are not needed because the [jquery-ujs](https://github.com/rails/jquery-ujs) library updates header automatically, see [jquery-ujs documentation](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/a-tour-of-rails-jquery-ujs#cross-site-request-forgery-protection).



## API

The best source of docs is the main [ReactOnRails.js](https://github.com/shakacode/react_on_rails/node_package/src/ReactOnRails.js) file. Here's a quick summary. No guarantees that this won't be outdated!

```js
  /**
   * Main entry point to using the react-on-rails npm package. This is how Rails will be able to
   * find you components for rendering. Components get called with props, or you may use a
   * "Render-Function" to return a React component or an object with the following shape:
   * { renderedHtml, redirectLocation, error }.
   * For server rendering, if you wish to return multiple HTML strings from a Render-Function,
   * you may return an Object from your Render-Function with a single top level property of
   * renderedHtml. Inside this Object, place a key called componentHtml, along with any other
   * needed keys. This is useful when you using side effects libraries like react helmet.
   * Your Ruby code with get this Object as a Hash containing keys componentHtml and any other
   * custom keys that you added:
   * { renderedHtml: { componentHtml, customKey1, customKey2 } }
   * See the example in https://www.shakacode.com/react-on-rails/docs/javascript/react-helmet
   * @param components (key is component name, value is component)
   */
  register(components)

  /**
   * Allows registration of store generators to be used by multiple react components on one Rails
   * view. store generators are functions that take one arg, props, and return a store. Note that
   * the setStore API is different in tha it's the actual store hydrated with props.
   * @param stores (key is store name, value is the store generator)
   */
  registerStore(stores)

  /**
   * Allows retrieval of the store by name. This store will be hydrated by any Rails form props.
   * Pass optional param throwIfMissing = false if you want to use this call to get back null if the
   * store with name is not registered.
   * @param name
   * @param throwIfMissing Defaults to true. Set to false to have this call return undefined if
   *        there is no store with the given name.
   * @returns Redux Store, possibly hydrated
   */
  getStore(name, throwIfMissing = true )

  /**
   * Set options for ReactOnRails, typically before you call ReactOnRails.register
   * Available Options:
   * `traceTurbolinks: true|false Gives you debugging messages on Turbolinks events
   */
  setOptions(options)

  /**
   * Allow directly calling the page loaded script in case the default events that trigger react
   * rendering are not sufficient, such as when loading JavaScript asynchronously with TurboLinks:
   * More details can be found here:
   * https://www.shakacode.com/react-on-rails/docs/rails/turbolinks
   */
  reactOnRailsPageLoaded()

  /**
   * Returns CSRF authenticity token inserted by Rails csrf_meta_tags
   * @returns String or null
   */

  authenticityToken()

  /**
   * Returns header with csrf authenticity token and XMLHttpRequest
   * @param {*} other headers
   * @returns {*} header
   */

  authenticityHeaders(otherHeaders = {})
```
