# Install and Release

We're now releasing this as a combined ruby gem plus npm package. We will keep the version numbers in sync.

## Testing the Gem before Release from a Rails App
See [Contributing](../../CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Releasing a new gem version
Run `rake -D release` to see instructions on how to release via the rake task.


As of 01-26-2016, this would give you an output like this:

```
rake release[gem_version,dry_run,tools_install]
    Releases both the gem and node package using the given version.

    IMPORTANT: the gem version must be in valid rubygem format (no dashes).
    It will be automatically converted to a valid npm semver by the rake task
    for the node package version. This only makes a difference for pre-release
    versions such as `3.0.0.beta.1` (npm version would be `3.0.0-beta.1`).

    This task will also globally install gem-release (ruby gem) and
    release-it (node package) unless you specify skip installing tools.

    2nd argument: Perform a dry run by passing 'true' as a second argument.
    3rd argument: Skip installing tools by passing 'false' as a third argument (default is true).

    Example: `rake release[2.1.0,false,false]`
```

Running `rake release[2.1.0]` will create a commit that looks like this:

```
