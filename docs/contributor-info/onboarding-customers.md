# Creating a github OAuth Token

Justin Gordon, justin@shakacode.com, should do the following:

1. Create an email (aka Google Group) for the new account.
2. Create a github account.
3. Grant read-only access to *only* this repo (and maybe the other React on Rails Pro examples).

# Customer Steps
See [Installation](../installation.md).
