# 15-Minute Quick Start Guide

> **Get your first React component running in Rails in 15 minutes**

This guide will have you rendering React components in your Rails app as quickly as possible. We'll skip the theory for now and focus on getting something working.

## âœ… Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- **ðŸš¨ React on Rails 16.0+** (this guide)
- **ðŸš¨ Shakapacker 6+** (7+ recommended for React on Rails 16)
- **Rails 7+** application (Rails 5.2+ supported)
- **Ruby 3.0+** (required)
- **Node.js 18+** and **Yarn**
- **Basic familiarity** with React and Rails

> ðŸ’¡ **Don't have a Rails app?** Run `rails new my_react_app` first.

## ðŸ“¦ Step 1: Install React on Rails (3 minutes)

Add the React on Rails gem and run its installer:

```bash
# Add the gem
bundle add react_on_rails --strict

# Commit your changes (required for generator)
git add . && git commit -m "Add react_on_rails gem"

# Run the installer
bin/rails generate react_on_rails:install
```

Take a look at the files created by the generator.

- jsx files created
- Shakapacker install
- React component files in `client/`
- A sample controller and view
- Webpack configuration

## ðŸŽ¯ Step 2: Start the Development Server (1 minute)

Start both Rails and the Webpack dev server:

```bash
./bin/dev
```

This starts both:

- Rails server on `http://localhost:3000`
- Webpack dev server for hot reloading

## ðŸŽ¨ Step 3: See Your Component (2 minutes)

Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:3000/hello_world
```

You should see a page with a React component saying "Hello World"!

ðŸŽ‰ **Congratulations!** You have React running in your Rails app.

## ðŸ”§ Step 4: Edit Your Component (2 minutes)

Let's make a quick change to see hot reloading in action:

1. Open `app/javascript/src/HelloWorld/ror_components/HelloWorld.client.jsx`
2. Change the text from "Hello World" to "Hello from React!"
3. Save the file
4. Watch your browser automatically refresh

## ðŸš€ Step 5: Add Components to Existing Views (5 minutes)

Now let's add a React component to one of your existing Rails views:

### Create a New Component

```bash
# Create a new component directory
mkdir -p app/javascript/src/SimpleCounter/ror_components

# Create the component file
touch app/javascript/src/SimpleCounter/ror_components/SimpleCounter.jsx
```

Add this content to `SimpleCounter.jsx`:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const SimpleCounter = ({ initialCount = 0 }) => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialCount);

  return (
    <div style={{ padding: '20px', border: '1px solid #ccc' }}>
      <h3>React Counter</h3>
      <p>
        Current count: <strong>{count}</strong>
      </p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}>Decrement</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(0)}>Reset</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default SimpleCounter;
```

### Use It in a Rails View (Auto-Bundling)

With React on Rails auto-bundling, you don't need manual registration! Just add this to any Rails view (like `app/views/application/index.html.erb`):

```erb
<h1>My Rails App</h1>

<p>Here's a React component embedded in this Rails view:</p>

<%= react_component("SimpleCounter", { initialCount: 5 }, { auto_load_bundle: true }) %>
```

Note, your layout needs to include this in the <head>:

```erb
    <%= stylesheet_pack_tag %>
    <%= javascript_pack_tag %>
```

That's it! React on Rails will automatically:

- âœ… Find your component in any directory named `ror_components` (configurable)
- âœ… Create optimized webpack bundles with code splitting
- âœ… Register the component for immediate use
- âœ… Include only necessary JavaScript on each page (reduces bundle size)

> **ðŸš€ Performance Tip:** Auto-bundling automatically optimizes your JavaScript delivery by only loading components used on each page, significantly reducing initial bundle size compared to manual bundling.

Restart your server and visit the page - you should see your interactive counter!

## âœ… What You've Accomplished

In 15 minutes, you've:

- âœ… Installed and configured React on Rails
- âœ… Seen server-side rendering in action
- âœ… Experienced hot module reloading
- âœ… Created and used a custom React component with auto-bundling
- âœ… Passed props from Rails to React
- âœ… Used zero-configuration automatic bundling (no manual pack setup!)
