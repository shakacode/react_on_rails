# React on Rails Pro: Introducing React Server Components & SSR Streaming

**Subject: 🚀 Revolutionary Performance Boost: React Server Components & SSR Streaming Now Available in React on Rails Pro**

---

Dear Valued React on Rails Pro Client,

We're thrilled to announce a major update: React on Rails Pro now supports **React Server Components** and **Server‑Side Rendering (SSR) Streaming**. These features have driven significant performance gains in real‑world applications—here’s how they can transform yours.

## 🎯 What This Means for Your Applications

- **Faster load times**
- **Smaller JavaScript bundles**
- **Better Core Web Vitals**
- **Improved SEO**
- **Smoother user interactions**

## 🔥 React Server Components

Server Components execute on the server and stream HTML to the client—no extra JavaScript in your bundle. Real‑world results include:

- **62% reduction** in client‑side bundle size on productonboarding.com when migrating to RSC [[1]]
- **63% improvement** in Google Speed Index on the RSC version of the same site [[1]]
- **52% smaller** JavaScript codebase and Lighthouse scores rising from \~50 to 90+ on GeekyAnts.com [[2]]

## 🌊 SSR Streaming

SSR Streaming sends HTML to the browser in chunks as it’s generated, enabling progressive rendering:

- **30% faster** full‑page load times at Hulu by combining streaming SSR with Server Components [[3]]
- Popular libraries like styled‑components v3.1.0 have introduced streaming SSR support as the next generation of React app rendering [[4]]

## 📊 Core Web Vitals & TTI Improvements

- **60% faster** Time to Interactive on Meta’s developer portal after adopting RSC (from 3.5 s to \~1.4 s) [[5]]
- **45% quicker** First Contentful Paint in the same migration [[5]]
- **50% lower** server response time with Server Components [[5]]
- **15% improvement** in Core Web Vitals and **23% reduction** in Time to First Byte at Airbnb after RSC migration [[5]]
