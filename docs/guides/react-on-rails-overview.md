# React on Rails

React on Rails integrates Rails with (server rendering of) Facebook's [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) front-end framework.

---

# Project Objective

To provide a high performance framework for integrating Ruby on Rails with React via the [**Shakapacker**](https://github.com/shakacode/shakapacker) gem especially in regards to React Server-Side Rendering for better SEO and improved performance.

# Features and Why React on Rails?

1. Easy passing of props directly from your Rails view to your React components rather than having your Rails view load and then make a separate request to your API.
1. Tight integration with [shakacode/shakapacker](https://github.com/shakacode/shakapacker).
1. Server-Side Rendering (SSR), often used for SEO crawler indexing and UX performance, is not offered by `shakacode/shakapacker`.
1. Support for HMR for a great developer experience.
1. Supports latest versions of React with hooks.
1. [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) and [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router#readme) integration including server-side-rendering.
1. [Internationalization (I18n) and (localization)](https://www.shakacode.com/react-on-rails/docs/guides/i18n/)
1. A supportive community. This [web search shows how live public sites are using React on Rails](https://publicwww.com/websites/%22react-on-rails%22++-undeveloped.com+depth%3Aall/).
1. [ReScript (Reason ML) Support](https://github.com/shakacode/reason-react-on-rails-example).

See the [react-webpack-rails-tutorial](https://github.com/shakacode/react-webpack-rails-tutorial) for an example of a live implementation and code.
