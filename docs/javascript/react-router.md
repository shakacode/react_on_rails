_This article needs updating for the latest version of React Router_

# Using React Router


React on Rails supports the use of React Router. Client-side code doesn't need any special configuration for the React on Rails gem. Implement React Router how you normally would. Note, you might want to avoid using Turbolinks as both Turbolinks and React-Router will be trying to handle the back and forward buttons. If you get this figured out, please do share with the community! Otherwise, you might have to tweak the basic settings for Turbolinks, and this may or may not be worth the effort.

If you are working with the HelloWorldApp created by the react_on_rails generator, then the code below corresponds to the module in `client/app/bundles/HelloWorld/startup/HelloWorldApp.jsx`.

```js

import { BrowserRouter, Switch } from 'react-router-dom'
import routes from './routes.jsx'

const RouterApp = (props, railsContext) => {
  // create your hydrated store
  const store = createStore(props);
  
  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      <BrowserRouter>
        <Switch>
          {routes}
        </Switch>
      </BrowserRouter>
    </Provider>
  );
};
```

# Server Rendering Using React Router V4

Your Render-Function may not return an object with the property `renderedHtml`. Thus, you call 
renderToString() and return an object with this property.

This example **only applies to server rendering** and should be only used in the server side bundle.

From the [original example in the ReactRouter docs](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/v4.3.1/packages/react-router-dom/docs/guides/server-rendering.md)
 
```javascript
   import React from 'react'
   import { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server'
   import { StaticRouter } from 'react-router'
   import { Provider } from 'react-redux'
   import ReactOnRails from 'react-on-rails'

   // App.jsx from src/client/App.jsx
   import App from '../App'

   const ReactServerRenderer = (props, railsContext) => {
      const context = {}

      // commentStore from src/server/store/commentStore
      const store = ReactOnRails.getStore('../store/commentStore')

      // Route Store generated from react-on-rails
      
      const { location } = railsContext

      const html = ReactDOMServer.renderToString(
        <Provider store={store}>
          <StaticRouter
            location={location}
            context={context}
            props={props}
          >
            <App />
          </StaticRouter>
        </ Provider>
        )

        if (context.url) {
          // Somewhere a `<Redirect>` was rendered
          redirect(301, context.url)
        } else {
          // we're good, send the response
          return { renderedHtml: html };
        }
    }
  }
```
