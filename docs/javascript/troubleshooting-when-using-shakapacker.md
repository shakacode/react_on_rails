# Client rendering crashes when configuring `optimization.runtimeChunk` to `multiple`

## Context

1. Ruby version: 3.1
2. Rails version: 7.0.6
3. Shakapacker version: 6.6.0
4. React on Rails version: 13.3.5

## The failure

Configuring Webpack to embed the runtime in each chunk and calling `react_component` twice in a rails view/partial causes the client render to crash with the following error:

```
Could not find component registered with name XXX. Registered component names include [ YYY ]. Maybe you forgot to register the component?
```

```
VM4859 clientStartup.js:132 Uncaught Error: ReactOnRails encountered an error while rendering component: XXX. See above error message.

## Configs

### Webpack configuration

```js
optimization: {
  runtimeChunk: 'multiple'
},
```

### Rails view

```haml
= react_component("XXX", props: @props)
= yield
= react_component("YYY", props: @props)
```

## The problem

Configuring Webpack to embed the runtime in each chunk and calling `react_component` twice in a rails view/partial causes the client render to crash.

## Solution

To overcome this issue, we could use [shakapacker](https://github.com/shakacode/shakapacker)'s default optimization configuration (pseudo-code):

```js
const { webpackConfig: baseClientWebpackConfig } = require('shakapacker');

// ...

config.optimization = baseClientWebpackConfig.optimization;
```
As it set the `optimization.runtimeChunk` to `single`. See its source:

`package/environments/base.js:115`
```js
  optimization: {
    splitChunks: { chunks: 'all' },

    runtimeChunk: 'single'
  },
```
https://github.com/shakacode/shakapacker/blob/cdf32835d3e0949952b8b4b53063807f714f9b24/package/environments/base.js#L115-L119

Or set `optimization.runtimeChunk` to `single` directly.
