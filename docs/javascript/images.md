You are free to use images either in image tags or as background images in SCSS files. You can
use a "global" location of /client/app/assets/images or a relative path to your JS or SCSS file, as
is done with CSS modules.

**images** is a defined alias, so "images/foobar.jpg" would point to the file at
`/client/app/assets/images/foobar.jpg.`

```
 resolve: {
    alias: {
      images: join(process.cwd(), 'app', 'assets', 'images'),
    },
  },
```
