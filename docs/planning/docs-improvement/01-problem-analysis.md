# React on Rails Documentation - Detailed Problem Analysis

**Date:** September 30, 2025
**Analyst:** Ihab
**Goal:** Identify specific issues preventing users from having a smooth, professional documentation experience

---

## 1. Information Architecture Problems

### 1.1 Unclear Category Hierarchy

**Problem:** The current 11-category structure lacks clear hierarchy and logical grouping.

**Current Categories** (defined in `gatsby-node.js:31-44`):

```javascript
const reactOnRailsDocsFoldersOrder = [
  firstCategory, // Root-level files
  'Guides', // 18+ diverse topics
  'Rails', // Rails-specific integration
  'Javascript', // JS/webpack/bundling topics
  'Additional details', // Catch-all category
  'Deployment', // Production setup
  'React on rails pro', // Pro version features
  'Api', // API reference
  'Misc', // Another catch-all
  'Contributor info', // Developer-facing docs
  'Testimonials', // Marketing content
  'Outdated', // Deprecated docs
];
```

**Specific Issues:**

1. **"Additional details"** - Vague catch-all containing:

   - `migrating-from-react-rails.md` (migration guide)
   - `generator-details.md` (technical reference)
   - `recommended-project-structure.md` (best practices)
   - `updating-dependencies.md` (maintenance)
   - These belong in different categories based on user intent

2. **"Misc"** - Another unclear bucket with:

   - `tips.md` - General guidance (should be in guides)
   - `doctrine.md` - Philosophy/principles (should be in introduction)
   - `style.md` - Code style guide (contributor docs)
   - `articles.md` - External resources (should be separate section)

3. **"Guides" is too broad** - Contains 18+ files ranging from:
   - Installation (`installation-into-an-existing-rails-app.md`)
   - Tutorials (`tutorial.md`)
   - Configuration (`configuration.md`)
   - Advanced features (`streaming-server-rendering.md`)
   - How-tos (`how-to-conditionally-server-render-based-on-device-type.md`)

**Impact:**

- Users don't know where to look for specific information
- No clear progression from beginner to advanced
- Similar topics scattered across multiple categories

**Source Files:**

- Category definition: `/home/ihab/ihab/work/shakacode/sc-website/gatsby-node.js:31-44`
- Sidebar rendering: `/home/ihab/ihab/work/shakacode/sc-website/src/styleguide/page-components/DocArticle/DocSidebar.tsx:178-253`

---

### 1.2 Multiple, Conflicting Entry Points

**Problem:** Four different "starting point" documents create confusion about where to begin.

**Entry Points Found:**

1. **`docs/README.md`** (173 lines)

   - Comprehensive navigation hub
   - Learning paths section (lines 13-36)
   - Popular use cases table (lines 40-49)
   - Complete TOC (lines 107-173)
   - **Issue:** Too long for a README, actually a full navigation page

2. **`docs/home.md`** (29 lines)

   - Minimal landing page
   - Just links to other docs
   - **Issue:** Unclear purpose - why exists separately from README?

3. **`docs/getting-started.md`** (254 lines)

   - Installation instructions
   - System requirements
   - Basic usage examples
   - **Issue:** Mixed beginner onboarding + reference material

4. **`docs/quick-start/README.md`** (location referenced but not yet examined)
   - Promised "15-minute" quick start
   - **Issue:** Buried in subdirectory, not prominently featured

**Confusion Points:**

From `README.md:9-11`:

```markdown
**‚Üí [15-Minute Quick Start Guide](./quick-start/README.md)**

Already have Rails + Shakapacker? **‚Üí [Add to existing app guide](./guides/installation-into-an-existing-rails-app.md)**
```

From `getting-started.md:3-11`:

```markdown
> **üí° Looking for the fastest way to get started?** Try our **[15-Minute Quick Start Guide](./quick-start/README.md)** instead.

## Choose Your Starting Point

...

### üöÄ **New to React on Rails?**

**‚Üí [15-Minute Quick Start](./quick-start/README.md)** - Get your first component working fast
```

**Impact:**

- New users see 4 different "start here" options
- Each document has different content and depth
- No clear answer to "where do I actually start?"
- Cross-references between docs create circular navigation

---

### 1.3 Mixing User-Facing and Internal Documentation

**Problem:** Navigation includes docs meant only for contributors, not end users.

**Contributor Docs in Main Navigation:**

1. **`contributor-info/` folder** - 5 files:

   - `linters.md` - Linting setup for contributors
   - `coding-agents-guide.md` - Guide for AI coding assistants
   - `errors-with-hooks.md` - Git hooks troubleshooting
   - `generator-testing.md` - Testing generators during development
   - `releasing.md` - Release process for maintainers
   - `pull-requests.md` - PR guidelines

2. **Planning documents visible:**

   - `docs/planning/DOCUMENTATION_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md`
   - `docs/planning/DOCS_PR_SUMMARY.md`
   - These are internal planning docs, not user documentation

3. **Root-level internal docs:**
   - `docs/MONOREPO_MERGER_PLAN.md` (32KB)
   - `docs/MONOREPO_MERGER_PLAN_REF.md`
   - `docs/DIRECTORY_LICENSING.md`
   - Internal project management documents

**Impact:**

- Cluttered navigation overwhelms users
- Professional appearance undermined by internal notes
- Users may read contributor docs and get confused
- Signal-to-noise ratio is poor

**Evidence:**
From `gatsby-node.js:185-194`, the build system includes ALL markdown files:

```javascript
result.data.docs.edges.forEach(({ node: doc }) => {
  const [, relativePath] = doc.dir.split('gatsby-source-git/');
  const [repoName, , folder] = relativePath.split('/');
  // Creates pages for ALL .md files in docs/
});
```

---

### 1.4 Outdated Content Visible in Navigation

**Problem:** A category called "Outdated" is visible in primary navigation.

**Outdated Folder Contents:**

- `docs/outdated/deferred-rendering.md`
- `docs/outdated/webpack-v1-notes.md`
- `docs/outdated/rails3.md`
- `docs/outdated/rails-assets.md`
- `docs/outdated/rails-assets-relative-paths.md`

**Current Treatment:**
From `gatsby-node.js:31-44`, "Outdated" is the last category but still included:

```javascript
const reactOnRailsDocsFoldersOrder = [
  // ... other categories
  'Outdated', // ‚Üê Still in navigation!
];
```

**Issues:**

1. **Confusing for users:** Why show documentation that's explicitly marked outdated?
2. **Unprofessional appearance:** Competitors don't expose deprecated docs in main navigation
3. **Decision fatigue:** Users don't know if current docs might also be outdated
4. **SEO pollution:** Old docs may rank in search results

**Better Practices (from competitors):**

- **Next.js:** Outdated docs moved to versioned URLs (`nextjs.org/docs/pages/...` for old Pages Router)
- **TanStack:** Clear version switcher, old versions in separate navigation trees
- **Rails Guides:** Each version has separate docs site (`guides.rubyonrails.org/v7.0/...`)

**Impact:**

- Undermines confidence in documentation quality
- Wastes user time exploring irrelevant docs
- Poor first impression for evaluating developers

---

## 2. Beginner Onboarding Gaps

### 2.1 Concepts Not Explained Before Usage

**Problem:** Documentation jumps into implementation details without explaining foundational concepts.

**Example 1: Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**

From `getting-started.md:93-97`:

````erb
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Your React component is first rendered into HTML on the server. Use the **prerender** option:

  ```erb
  <%= react_component("HelloWorld", props: @some_props, prerender: true) %>
````

````

**Missing Context:**
- What is SSR and why does it matter?
- What's the difference between client-side and server-side rendering?
- When should I use `prerender: true` vs not using it?
- What are the performance implications?
- What are the limitations?

Users see `prerender: true` without understanding the "why" behind it.

---

**Example 2: Auto-Bundling**

From `getting-started.md:101-138`:
```markdown
## Auto-Bundling (includes Auto-Registration)

React on Rails supports **Auto-Bundling**, which automatically creates the webpack bundle _and_ registers your React components. This means you don't have to manually configure packs or call `ReactOnRails.register(...)`.
````

**Missing Context:**

- What is "bundling" in the first place?
- What's the difference between auto-bundling and manual bundling?
- What are "packs"? (Assumed knowledge from Webpacker)
- Why does component registration matter?
- What happens under the hood?
- When should I NOT use auto-bundling?

The comparison between manual and auto-bundling helps, but assumes user understands webpack concepts.

---

**Example 3: Render Functions**

From `getting-started.md:178-204`:

```markdown
## Specifying Your React Components

You have two ways to specify your React components. You can either register the React component (either function or class component) directly, or you can create a function that returns a React component, which we using the name of a "render-function".
```

**Missing Context:**

- What is a "render-function" conceptually?
- Why would I need one vs. a regular component?
- How is this different from React's render function?
- Custom terminology ("render-function") not explained before use

---

**Pattern Observed:**

The docs follow a "reference manual" pattern:

1. Here's a feature
2. Here's the syntax
3. Here's an example

Instead of a "learning guide" pattern:

1. Here's a problem you might have
2. Here's how this feature solves it
3. Here's when to use it
4. Here's how to implement it

**Impact:**

- High cognitive load for beginners
- Users copy-paste without understanding
- Harder to debug when things go wrong
- Users can't make informed architectural decisions

---

### 2.2 Installation Instructions Scattered

**Problem:** Installation steps are fragmented across multiple documents without clear ownership.

**Installation Information Locations:**

1. **`getting-started.md:38-76`** - "Basic Installation"

   - Rails app creation
   - Shakapacker prerequisites
   - Generator command
   - Starting the app

2. **`guides/installation-into-an-existing-rails-app.md`** - Full guide

   - (Not yet examined but referenced multiple times)
   - Seems to be the canonical installation guide
   - But not clearly marked as THE starting point

3. **`quick-start/README.md`** - Quick installation

   - Promised "15-minute" path
   - Unclear how it differs from other guides

4. **`README.md:44`** - Installation link in table:

```markdown
| **Add React to existing Rails app** | [Installation Guide](./guides/installation-into-an-existing-rails-app.md) |
```

5. **`guides/tutorial.md`** - Tutorial installation
   - Likely has its own installation steps
   - May differ from other guides

**Inconsistencies:**

From `getting-started.md:50-56`:

```bash
bundle add react_on_rails --version=16.0.0 --strict

# Commit this to git (or else you cannot run the generator in the next step unless you pass the option `--ignore-warnings`).
```

**Questions raised:**

- Why must I commit before running generator?
- What happens if I don't commit?
- What is `--ignore-warnings`?
- Why is version hardcoded to 16.0.0?

These concerns aren't addressed in context.

**Impact:**

- Users don't know which guide to follow
- Different guides may have conflicting steps
- Hard to maintain consistency across guides
- Users may skip crucial setup steps

---

### 2.3 Missing Prerequisites and Assumptions

**Problem:** Documentation assumes knowledge that beginners may not have.

**Assumed Knowledge Examples:**

**1. Shakapacker (critical dependency)**

From `getting-started.md:36`:

```markdown
> **Don't have Shakapacker?** It's the modern replacement for Webpacker and required for React on Rails.
```

**Issues:**

- What is Shakapacker? (one sentence doesn't explain it)
- Why is it required?
- What if I'm using Vite or another bundler?
- How do I install it?
- Link to Shakapacker docs, but user leaves React on Rails docs

**2. Webpack Configuration**

Multiple references to webpack throughout docs assume user understanding:

- `docs/guides/webpack-configuration.md` - Entire guide about webpack
- `docs/javascript/webpack.md` - Another webpack guide
- References to "packs", "bundles", "entry points"

No explanation of:

- What webpack is
- Why React on Rails needs it
- How it integrates with Rails

**3. Rails Asset Pipeline**

From `getting-started.md:82-83`:

```markdown
- Configure `config/initializers/react_on_rails.rb`. You can adjust some necessary settings and defaults.
- Configure `config/shakapacker.yml`. If you used the generator and the default Shakapacker setup, you don't need to touch this file.
```

**Assumptions:**

- User knows what Rails initializers are
- User understands YAML configuration
- User knows where config files live
- User can debug if generator didn't create these files

**4. Node.js Ecosystem**

From `getting-started.md:34`:

```markdown
‚úÖ **Node.js 18+**
```

**Missing information:**

- How to install Node.js
- Why this specific version?
- How to manage multiple Node versions
- What if my Rails app uses a different version?

**Impact:**

- Beginners get stuck on prerequisites
- Support burden increases with basic questions
- Users abandon setup process
- Poor first impression compared to competitors with better onboarding

---

## 3. Content Organization Issues

### 3.1 No Clear Progressive Disclosure

**Problem:** All information presented at once without difficulty levels or learning paths.

**Current Structure (Flat):**

From `README.md:52-79`, the "Complete Documentation" section lists everything:

```markdown
## üìñ Complete Documentation

### Core Guides

- Getting Started
- Tutorial
- Configuration
- View Helpers

### Features

- Server-Side Rendering
- Auto-Bundling
- Redux Integration
- React Router
- Internationalization

### Development

- Hot Module Replacement
- Testing
- Debugging

### Deployment & Performance

- Deployment
- Performance
- Bundle Optimization
```

**Issues:**

1. **No difficulty indicators:** All topics appear equal in complexity
2. **No prerequisites shown:** Can't tell what to read first
3. **No estimated time:** Users can't plan their learning
4. **No "required vs. optional":** Everything seems equally important

**Example of Confusion:**

A beginner might click "Streaming Server Rendering" (advanced) before understanding basic "Server-Side Rendering" (fundamental).

From the docs structure:

- `docs/guides/react-server-rendering.md` - Basic SSR
- `docs/guides/streaming-server-rendering.md` - Advanced SSR
- Both in same "Guides" category with no indication of order

---

**Better Pattern (from competitors):**

**Next.js Approach:**

```
Getting Started (15 min)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Installation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Project Structure
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Your First Page

Building Your Application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Routing
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Data Fetching
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Rendering
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Styling

[Much later...]

Advanced Features
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Streaming
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Server Actions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Partial Prerendering
```

Clear progression with time estimates and prerequisites.

---

**TanStack Router Approach:**

```
üî∞ Quick Start
üìò Guide (Basics)
üìó Guide (Advanced)
üìï API Reference
```

Visual indicators show learning level.

---

**React on Rails Current Experience:**

A user could accidentally read in this order:

1. "Streaming Server Rendering" (advanced Pro feature)
2. "How to conditionally server render based on device type" (advanced how-to)
3. "React Server Rendering" (basic concept)

Because all are in "Guides" with alphabetical ordering.

**Impact:**

- Beginners get overwhelmed by advanced topics
- Advanced users frustrated by basic content mixed in
- No clear path from "beginner" to "expert"
- Higher abandonment rate during learning

---

### 3.2 API Reference Mixed with Guides

**Problem:** Reference documentation not clearly separated from learning guides.

**Current "API" Category:**

From `docs/api/` folder:

- `README.md` - API overview
- `view-helpers-api.md` - `react_component` helper reference
- `redux-store-api.md` - Redux store API
- `javascript-api.md` - JavaScript API reference

**BUT, API information also appears in:**

1. **`getting-started.md:86-90`** - Shows `react_component` usage:

```erb
<%= react_component("HelloWorld", props: @some_props) %>
```

2. **`getting-started.md:206-222`** - Documents `react_component_hash`:

```markdown
## react_component_hash for Render-Functions

Another reason to use a Render-Function is that sometimes in server rendering, specifically with React Router, you need to return the result of calling ReactDOMServer.renderToString(element).
```

3. **`guides/configuration.md`** - Config API reference
4. **`guides/render-functions-and-railscontext.md`** - API for render functions

**Problems:**

1. **Duplication:** Same API documented in multiple places with potential inconsistencies
2. **No single source of truth:** Where do I look for definitive API docs?
3. **Mixed purposes:** Guides teach concepts, references list options - both needed but should be separate
4. **Discoverability:** If API is split across docs, users miss options

**Example of Confusion:**

User wants to know all options for `react_component` helper:

- Should they read `getting-started.md`?
- Or `api/view-helpers-api.md`?
- Or both?
- Are they consistent?

---

**Better Pattern:**

**Guides (Learning):**

```markdown
# Server-Side Rendering Guide

Learn how to render React components on the server for better performance and SEO.

## When to Use SSR

[Conceptual explanation...]

## Basic Example

[Simple working example...]

## Common Patterns

[Real-world use cases...]

üìö See full API: [react_component API Reference](/api/view-helpers-api)
```

**API Reference (Looking up specifics):**

```markdown
# react_component API Reference

Quick reference for all options and parameters.

## Syntax

<%= react_component(component_name, options) %>

## Parameters

### component_name (String, required)

The name of your registered React component.

### options (Hash, optional)

| Option    | Type    | Default | Description                  |
| --------- | ------- | ------- | ---------------------------- |
| props     | Hash    | {}      | Data to pass to component    |
| prerender | Boolean | false   | Enable server-side rendering |
| trace     | Boolean | false   | Enable render tracing        |

[Complete table of all options...]

## Examples

[Brief examples for quick reference...]

üìò Learn more: [Server-Side Rendering Guide](/guides/ssr)
```

**Impact:**

- Users can't quickly look up API options
- Risk of following outdated examples in guides
- Harder to maintain documentation
- Professional developers frustrated by poor reference docs

---

### 3.3 Testimonials and Marketing in Technical Docs

**Problem:** Marketing content mixed with technical documentation creates unprofessional impression.

**Current Structure:**

From `gatsby-node.js:41-42`:

```javascript
"Testimonials",
"Outdated",
```

"Testimonials" is a top-level category in the technical documentation.

**Testimonials Folder Contents:**

- `docs/testimonials/testimonials.md` - List of testimonials
- `docs/testimonials/hvmn.md` - HVMN case study
- `docs/testimonials/resortpass.md` - ResortPass case study

**Issues:**

1. **Wrong audience:** Users reading technical docs want to solve problems, not read testimonials
2. **Wrong context:** Testimonials belong on marketing site, not in documentation navigation
3. **Navigation clutter:** Takes up space in sidebar that could be used for technical content
4. **Unprofessional:** Major frameworks don't mix these concerns

**Where Users Expect Testimonials:**

- Main marketing site homepage
- Dedicated "Case Studies" section on website
- "Why Choose React on Rails" landing page
- NOT in technical documentation sidebar

**Comparison with Competitors:**

**Next.js:**

- Technical docs: `nextjs.org/docs`
- Showcase/testimonials: `nextjs.org/showcase`
- Clearly separated

**Rails Guides:**

- Technical docs: `guides.rubyonrails.org`
- Testimonials: `rubyonrails.org/` (marketing site)
- Never mixed

**TanStack:**

- Docs: `tanstack.com/router/latest/docs`
- No testimonials in technical docs
- Marketing content on separate pages

---

**What to Do with Testimonials:**

1. **Move to marketing site:** ShakaCode website should host these
2. **Create "Showcase" page:** Separate from docs navigation
3. **Link from introduction:** "See who uses React on Rails" ‚Üí external page
4. **Remove from docs navigation:** Keep technical docs technical

**Impact:**

- Reduced professional credibility
- Distraction from learning and reference tasks
- Longer navigation lists with less relevant content
- Inconsistent with industry standards

---

### 3.4 Inconsistent Document Depth and Style

**Problem:** Documentation files vary wildly in length, detail, and writing style without clear purpose differentiation.

**Examples:**

**1. Extremely Short Docs:**

`docs/home.md` - 29 lines:

```markdown
# React on Rails

## Details

1. [Overview](./guides/react-on-rails-overview.md)
1. [Getting Started](./getting-started.md)
   ...
```

Just a list of links. Why does this exist separately from README?

---

**2. Extremely Long Docs:**

`docs/getting-started.md` - 254 lines

- Installation
- Configuration
- Usage examples
- API reference
- Render functions
- Error handling
- I18n
- Additional resources

Tries to be everything: tutorial, reference, guide, and quickstart.

`docs/README.md` - 173 lines

- Navigation hub
- Learning paths
- Use case table
- Complete TOC
- Multiple entry points

Tries to be landing page, navigation, and TOC all at once.

---

**3. Unclear Purpose:**

`docs/javascript/troubleshooting-build-errors.md` vs.
`docs/javascript/troubleshooting-when-using-shakapacker.md` vs.
`docs/troubleshooting/README.md`

Three troubleshooting docs - when do I use which one?

`docs/guides/webpack-configuration.md` vs.
`docs/javascript/webpack.md`

Two webpack guides in different categories. What's the difference?

---

**4. Style Inconsistencies:**

**Some docs are conversational:**
From `getting-started.md:3`:

```markdown
> **üí° Looking for the fastest way to get started?** Try our **[15-Minute Quick Start Guide](./quick-start/README.md)** instead.
```

**Some are formal reference:**
From API docs:

```markdown
## react_component_hash for Render-Functions

Another reason to use a Render-Function is that sometimes in server rendering, specifically with React Router, you need to return the result of calling ReactDOMServer.renderToString(element).
```

**Some use checkboxes:**
From `getting-started.md:30-34`:

```markdown
‚úÖ **üö® React on Rails 16.0+** (this guide covers modern features)
‚úÖ **üö® Shakapacker 6+** (7+ recommended for React on Rails 16)
‚úÖ **Rails 7+** (Rails 5.2+ supported)
```

**Some use tables:**
From `README.md:42-49`:

```markdown
| I want to...                        | Go here                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Add React to existing Rails app** | [Installation Guide](./guides/installation-into-an-existing-rails-app.md) |
```

---

**Impact:**

- Users don't know what to expect from each document
- Some docs overwhelming, others too brief
- Inconsistent voice hurts professionalism
- Hard to maintain as team grows
- No clear document templates or guidelines

---

**Better Pattern:**

Clear document types with defined purposes:

1. **Tutorial:** Step-by-step, conversational, builds something, 20-40 min
2. **Guide:** Explains concept deeply, includes examples, 10-15 min read
3. **How-To:** Solves specific problem, terse, 5 min read
4. **Reference:** Lists all options, technical, quick lookup

Each type has:

- Consistent structure
- Expected length
- Appropriate tone
- Clear template

---

## 4. Technical Issues

### 4.1 Broken Internal Links Risk

**Problem:** Documentation uses relative links that may break during site reorganization.

**Examples of Relative Link Patterns:**

From `getting-started.md`:

```markdown
See file [docs/basics/configuration.md](./guides/configuration.md)
```

From `README.md`:

```markdown
- **[Quick Start](./quick-start/README.md)**
- **[Tutorial](./guides/tutorial.md)**
- **[Installation Guide](./guides/installation-into-an-existing-rails-app.md)**
```

**Risks:**

1. **Gatsby transformation:** Website build (`gatsby-node.js`) transforms these paths:

```javascript
// From: ./guides/tutorial.md
// To: /react-on-rails/docs/guides/tutorial/
```

2. **Link checking:** No automated link validation in CI
3. **Refactoring risk:** Moving files breaks links in multiple places
4. **Cross-references:** Complex web of interdependencies

**Evidence of Potential Issues:**

From `docs/planning/DOCUMENTATION_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md` exists but may have broken links to docs that were moved.

---

### 4.2 Images and Assets Organization

**Problem:** Image references and asset management unclear.

From `getting-started.md:168`:

```markdown
![Basic Hello World Example](./images/bundle-splitting-hello-world.png)
```

**Questions:**

- Where are images stored? (`docs/images/` folder exists)
- How are they served on the website?
- Are images optimized for web?
- Are there broken image links?
- How to add new images?

---

### 4.3 Search and Discoverability

**Problem:** No clear search functionality or metadata for discovery.

**Observations:**

1. **No frontmatter:** Most docs lack YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
title: Getting Started
description: Install React on Rails
keywords: [installation, setup, rails]
---
```

2. **No tags/categories in files:** Categories only in website code
3. **No search optimization:** Content not structured for search
4. **No related docs links:** Each doc is isolated

**Impact:**

- Users can't search documentation effectively
- Hard to discover related content
- Poor SEO for documentation pages
- Rely entirely on navigation structure

---

## 5. Missing Content

### 5.1 No "Why React on Rails?"

**Critical Missing Page:** Introduction explaining the value proposition.

**What's Missing:**

1. **Problem statement:**

   - Why integrate React with Rails?
   - What problems does React on Rails solve?
   - What are the alternatives?

2. **Comparison with alternatives:**

   - vs. plain Rails views
   - vs. separate React frontend
   - vs. react-rails gem
   - vs. Hotwire/Turbo
   - vs. Inertia.js

3. **When to use / when not to use:**

   - Best fit use cases
   - When to choose something else
   - Migration scenarios

4. **Architecture overview:**
   - How does it work at a high level?
   - What's the request/response flow?
   - Where does React run? (client/server)

**Current Situation:**

`docs/guides/react-on-rails-overview.md` exists but not clearly positioned as THE introduction.

**Impact:**

- Developers can't make informed decisions
- No clear pitch for managers/stakeholders
- Users jump into "how" before understanding "why"
- Harder to advocate for using React on Rails in teams

---

### 5.2 No Migration Paths

**Problem:** Sparse guidance on migrating existing applications.

**What Exists:**

- `docs/additional-details/migrating-from-react-rails.md` - Only one migration guide
- `docs/guides/upgrading-react-on-rails.md` - Version upgrades

**What's Missing:**

1. **Migrating from plain Rails views:**

   - How to gradually introduce React
   - Which views to convert first
   - Hybrid approach patterns

2. **Migrating from separate React frontend:**

   - Moving from React SPA to React on Rails
   - Sharing components
   - Authentication/session handling

3. **Migrating from Hotwire/Turbo:**

   - When to switch
   - How to coexist
   - Gradual migration strategy

4. **Version-to-version migration:**
   - Breaking changes documentation
   - Automated migration tools
   - Rollback strategies

**Impact:**

- Teams with existing apps hesitant to adopt
- No clear path from evaluation to production
- Risk assessment difficult
- Support burden with migration questions

### 5.3 No Troubleshooting Decision Tree

**Problem:** Troubleshooting docs are scattered without clear starting point.

**Current Troubleshooting Docs:**

- `docs/troubleshooting/README.md`
- `docs/javascript/troubleshooting-build-errors.md`
- `docs/javascript/troubleshooting-when-using-shakapacker.md`
- `docs/javascript/troubleshooting-when-using-webpacker.md`

**What's Missing:**

1. **Diagnostic flow:**

   ```
   Issue ‚Üí Is it build-time or run-time?
        ‚Üí Client or server?
        ‚Üí Webpack or Rails?
        ‚Üí [Specific guide]
   ```

2. **Common error messages:**

   - Database of actual error text
   - Direct solutions
   - Search optimization

3. **Debugging tools:**

   - How to enable trace mode
   - How to inspect SSR output
   - Browser devtools setup

4. **Getting help:**
   - What info to provide
   - Where to ask
   - How to create minimal reproduction

**Impact:**

- Users stuck without clear next steps
- Repeated support questions
- Frustration during debugging
- Higher abandonment rate

## Next Steps

This analysis will inform:

1. Information architecture redesign proposal
2. Content reorganization plan
3. Writing style guide
4. Documentation templates
5. Migration strategy

**Priority Order:**

1. Fix critical user journey (entry points, onboarding)
2. Restructure categories (IA redesign)
3. Hide internal docs (contributor/outdated)
4. Standardize document types (templates)
5. Add missing content (why, migration)
