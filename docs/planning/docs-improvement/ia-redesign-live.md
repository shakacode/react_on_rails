# IA Redesign - Live Implementation Tracker

**Purpose:** Track actual implementation progress for the documentation IA redesign. This file tracks what we're _actually doing_ and may diverge from the original plan as we learn and adapt.

**Reference Plan:** See `04-ia-redesign-plan.md` for the detailed original plan.

**Branch:** `feature/docs-ia-redesign`

**Started:** October 2, 2025

---

## Implementation Approach

We're breaking Phase 2 (File Reorganization) into 8 reviewable steps, pausing between each for review before proceeding.

### Why Step-by-Step?

- This is critical infrastructure - can't rush it
- Each step is reviewable and reversible
- Learn from each step before proceeding
- Catch issues early before they compound

---

## Decisions & Adaptations

This section tracks any deviations from the original plan and why we made them.

### Decision Log

#### Decision 1: Split Migration & Upgrading into Two Categories (Oct 2, 2025)

**Original plan:** Category 6 called "Migration & Upgrading" in one folder `migration/`

**Decision:** Split into TWO separate categories:

- Category 6: üìà **Upgrading** (`upgrading/`) - Version upgrades, release notes
- Category 7: üîÑ **Migrating** (`migrating/`) - From other tools (react-rails, angular, etc.)

**Rationale:**

- Research showed popular frameworks use separate "Upgrading" and "Migrating" sections
- Clear distinction: upgrading = staying with RoR between versions; migrating = coming FROM other tools
- Both are important enough to warrant separate categories
- Users have different intents: "I need to upgrade" vs "I'm switching from react-rails"
- Only adds 1 category (8 total vs original 7) - still way better than current 11

**New category structure:**

```
1. üöÄ Getting Started
2. üìö Core Concepts
3. üîß Building Features
4. üìñ API Reference
5. üö¢ Deployment
6. üìà Upgrading          ‚Üê NEW (split from Migration & Upgrading)
7. üîÑ Migrating          ‚Üê NEW (split from Migration & Upgrading)
8. üíé Pro
```

**Files affected:**

- `upgrading/`: upgrading-react-on-rails.md, release notes, version-specific guides
- `migrating/`: from-react-rails.md, from-angular.md

---

#### Decision 2: Keep Descriptive Long Filenames (Oct 2, 2025)

**Question:** Should we rename `installation-into-an-existing-rails-app.md` to just `installation.md`?

**Decision:** Keep the original long descriptive filename.

**Rationale:**

- The distinction between "existing Rails app" vs "new Rails app" is meaningful
- `tutorial.md` covers installation for NEW apps (with `rails new`)
- `installation-into-an-existing-rails-app.md` covers EXISTING apps (already have code)
- Shortening to `installation.md` creates ambiguity - users won't know which scenario it covers
- Descriptive filenames help users find the right doc for their situation

**Pattern:** Prefer descriptive filenames over short ones when there's meaningful distinction.

---

#### Decision 3: Move configuration.md to API Reference (Oct 2, 2025)

**Question:** Should `configuration.md` go in Core Concepts or API Reference?

**Decision:** Move to API Reference.

**Rationale:**

- `configuration.md` is a 391-line reference list of ALL config options
- Same format as `view-helpers-api.md` and `javascript-api.md` (method/parameter lists)
- Users look it up when they need a specific setting (reference usage pattern)
- Not teaching a concept - documenting an interface
- Core Concepts = understanding how things work; API Reference = lookup tables for methods/configs

**Pattern:** Reference lists of options/methods/parameters belong in API Reference, not Core Concepts.

---

#### Decision 4: Rethink Deployment Category - Remove Non-Deployment Files (Oct 3, 2025)

**Context:** After completing Step 5 (moving Deployment files), we reviewed what actually ended up in `deployment/` and found several files that don't belong.

**Problem:** The plan placed these files in Deployment, but upon review they're not deployment-specific.

**Decision:** Move these 5 files OUT of Deployment to proper categories (keeping original filenames per Decision 2):

1. `updating-dependencies.md` ‚Üí **misc/updating-dependencies.md** (temporary holding)
2. `turbolinks.md` ‚Üí **building-features/turbolinks.md** (feature integration)
3. `rails-engine-integration.md` ‚Üí **advanced-topics/rails-engine-integration.md** (temporary holding)
4. `convert-rails-5-api-only-app.md` ‚Üí **migrating/convert-rails-5-api-only-app.md** (prerequisite migration)
5. `rails_view_rendering_from_inline_javascript.md` ‚Üí **api-reference/rails_view_rendering_from_inline_javascript.md** (API reference)

**New temporary categories created:**

- `misc/` - For files that don't fit elsewhere (review at end)
- `advanced-topics/` - For advanced setup scenarios (review at end)

**Deployment category now contains (7 files):**

- Production deployment guides (4 files: deployment.md, capistrano, heroku, elastic-beanstalk)
- Troubleshooting production/CI issues (3 files)

**Rationale:**

- Don't force-fit files to match the plan if they don't belong
- Follow industry standards: categorize by user intent, not by technology
- Protect important categories from bloat
- Gather orphaned files in temporary categories for later review
- Deployment should be about getting to production and operating in production

**Pattern:** Categorize by WHEN and WHY users need the info, not by what technology it involves.

---

#### Decision 5: No "Rails" Category Needed (Oct 3, 2025)

**Question:** Should we create a "Rails" category for Rails-specific files?

**Decision:** NO - do not create a "Rails" category.

**Rationale:**

- React on Rails IS a Rails integration - everything is Rails-related
- A "Rails" category would become a dumping ground like the old "Additional details"
- Better to categorize by user intent (what are they trying to do?) not by technology
- Industry pattern: Stimulus, Turbo, Inertia.js don't have "Rails" categories
- Files from old `rails/` folder distributed to appropriate categories by intent

**Pattern:** Intent-based categorization (user journey) beats technology-based categorization.

---

## Issues & Blockers

### Issue 1: Content Overlap in Getting Started (Oct 2, 2025)

**Problem:** Three files overlap significantly in covering installation:

1. **quick-start.md** (212 lines)
   - 15-minute setup
   - Assumes existing Rails app (or just run `rails new`)
   - Steps: install gem ‚Üí run generator ‚Üí hello world
2. **installation-into-an-existing-rails-app.md** (67 lines)
   - Detailed installation for existing apps
   - Very similar steps to quick-start
3. **tutorial.md** (389 lines)
   - Comprehensive walkthrough with `rails new`
   - Includes installation + features + deployment

**Issue:** Users may be confused about which guide to follow. Content is redundant.

**Status:** Flagged for Section 2 (Content Improvements) - NOT fixing during IA reorg

**Next steps:** After completing IA restructuring, evaluate whether to:

- Merge quick-start and installation docs
- Delete one and improve the other
- Clarify when to use each with better headers/descriptions

_This is a content problem, not a structure problem. Keep moving files for now._

---

## Testing Notes

### Local Testing Strategy

- Use `gatsby develop` in sc-website repo pointing to this branch
- Verify categories render correctly
- Check navigation flow
- Test internal links

_Test results will be logged here as we go_

---

## Completion Summary

**‚úÖ ALL STEPS COMPLETE (Steps 1-8):**

- Step 1: Getting Started (4 files)
- Step 2: Core Concepts (7 files) + API Reference (1 file)
- Step 3: Building Features (14 files)
- Step 4: API Reference (4 files)
- Step 5: Deployment (9 files, then corrected to 7)
- Step 6: Upgrading (4 files, then moved 1 to pro)
- Step 7: Migrating (2 files)
- Step 8: Pro (1 file)

**‚úÖ ORPHANED FILES REORGANIZED (12 files):**
After Steps 1-8, found 12 files not in original plan. Investigated and reorganized:

- 7 moved to existing categories
- 4 moved to outdated/
- 1 merged and deleted

**Total files moved:** ~50+ files across all steps

**Next Actions:** Update website config, update internal links, create introduction.md

```

**Final Decisions:**

- `misc/` and `advanced-topics/` are now PERMANENT categories (not temporary)
- All orphaned files found homes
- Old folders (guides/, javascript/, additional-details/, etc.) are now EMPTY

See `04-ia-redesign-plan.md` for original plan (NOTE: this live doc is source of truth after Steps 1-8 + orphaned files).
