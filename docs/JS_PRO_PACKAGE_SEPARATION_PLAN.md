# PR #4: Split JS Pro Code to Separate Package - Implementation Plan

This comprehensive plan documents all architectural decisions and implementation steps for separating JavaScript Pro functionality from the core React-on-Rails package into a separate `react-on-rails-pro` package.

## Core Architectural Decisions

### 1. Package Dependency Strategy

- **Decision**: Pro package uses core as a **dependency** (not peer dependency)
- **Rationale**: Follows React's model, eliminates user version management complexity, prevents "forgetting to import" issues
- **Implementation**: Pro package exports all core functionality + pro features
- **User Experience**:
  - Core users: `import ReactOnRails from 'react-on-rails'`
  - Pro users: `import ReactOnRails from 'react-on-rails-pro'` (gets everything)
- **Benefits**: Single import decision per project, no multi-entry-point issues

### 2. Versioning Strategy

- **Decision**: Caret range strategy (`^16.1.0`)
- **Rationale**: Follows React-DOM pattern (`react-dom` uses `^19.1.1` for react)
- **Implementation**: Major version alignment required, minor/patch independence allowed
- **Pro package.json**: `"dependencies": { "react-on-rails": "^16.1.0" }`

### 3. Registry Architecture

- **Decision**: Dual registry system with direct imports based on package context
- **Core Package**: Simple Map-based registries (synchronous only, pre-force-load behavior)
- **Pro Package**: Advanced CallbackRegistry-based (async + synchronous, post-force-load behavior)
- **Import Strategy**:
  - **MIT files** → Import **core registries** directly
  - **Pro files** → Import **pro registries** directly
  - **Shared files** → Use `globalThis.ReactOnRails.get()` methods

### 4. Code Reuse Strategy (DRY Principle)

- **Decision**: Layer Pro features over Core functionality, reuse core rendering logic
- **Implementation**: Pro package imports and enhances core components where possible
- **Example**: Pro ClientSideRenderer uses core `createReactOutput()` and `reactHydrateOrRender()`
- **Benefits**: Maximizes DRY, reduces duplication, clear feature separation

### 5. Feature Split Strategy

Based on commit `4dee1ff3cff5998a38cfa758dec041ece9986623` analysis:

**Core Package (MIT) - Pre-Force-Load Behavior:**

- Simple synchronous registries
- Basic rendering without async waiting
- Methods: `register()`, `getComponent()`, `getStore()`, etc.

**Pro Package - Post-Force-Load Behavior:**

- Advanced async registries with CallbackRegistry
- Immediate hydration, store dependency waiting
- Methods: `getOrWaitForComponent()`, `getOrWaitForStore()`, `reactOnRailsComponentLoaded()`, etc.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create React-on-Rails-Pro Package Structure

**Checkpoint 1.1**: Create directory structure

- [x] Create `packages/react-on-rails-pro/` directory

- [x] Test pro-specific features:
  - Async component waiting (`getOrWaitForComponent`)
  - Async store waiting (`getOrWaitForStore`)
  - Immediate hydration feature
  - RSC functionality
- [x] Verify pro package works as complete replacement for core

2. **Unit Tests**: Run relevant unit test suites
3. **Integration Test**: Test functionality in dummy Rails application
4. **Regression Check**: Ensure no existing functionality broken
5. **License Validation**: Check license compliance maintained

### Validation Commands:

```bash
# Test workspace
yarn build
yarn test
yarn type-check
yarn lint

# Test individual packages
cd packages/react-on-rails && yarn build && yarn test
cd packages/react-on-rails-pro && yarn build && yarn test

# Test in dummy app
cd spec/dummy && yarn install && yarn build
```

## Rollback Strategy

### Git Strategy:

- Each major step should be a separate commit with clear commit message
- Use descriptive commit messages: `"Step 4.1: Move pro files to pro package"`
- Tag successful major milestones

### Rollback Process:

1. **Identify Issue**: Determine which step introduced the problem
2. **Revert Commits**: Use `git revert` to undo problematic changes
3. **Analyze Root Cause**: Understand what went wrong
4. **Fix and Retry**: Address the issue and re-attempt the step
5. **Validate**: Ensure fix resolves the problem without introducing new issues

## Key Implementation Principles

### 1. Direct Import Strategy

- **MIT files** import MIT registries directly (no indirection)
- **Pro files** import Pro registries directly (access to async methods)
- **Shared files** use `globalThis.ReactOnRails` for flexibility

### 2. No Complex Dependency Injection

- Avoid complex registry injection patterns
- Keep architecture simple and understandable
- Use direct imports for clear dependencies

### 3. Maintain Backward Compatibility

- Core users should see no changes in behavior
- Pro users get enhanced functionality seamlessly
- No breaking changes to existing APIs

### 4. License Boundary Integrity

- Maintain strict separation between MIT and Pro code
- Update LICENSE.md immediately when moving files
- Never allow pro code in MIT-licensed directories

### 5. Independent Package Builds

- Each package builds independently
- Pro package manages its dependency on core package
- Clean separation of concerns
