# Turbolinks and Turbo Support

## React on Rails Updated to support Turbo, August 2024

- See [PR 1620](https://github.com/shakacode/react_on_rails/pull/1620).
- See [PR 1374](https://github.com/shakacode/react_on_rails/pull/1374).
- Ability to use with [Turbo (`@hotwired/turbo`)](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/), as Turbolinks becomes obsolete.

# Using Turbo

To configure Turbo the following option can be set:
`ReactOnRails.setOptions({ turbo: true })`

Turbo is not auto-detected like older Turbolinks.

_TODO: Walk through code changes in PR 1620._

# Legacy Turbolinks

_The following docs may be outdated. We recommend updating to the latest Turbo or removing old Turbolinks._

- See [Turbolinks on Github](https://github.com/rails/turbolinks)
- React on Rails currently supports 2.5.x of Turbolinks and 5.0.0 of Turbolinks 5.
- You may include Turbolinks either via yarn (recommended) or via the gem.

## Why Turbolinks?

As you switch between Rails HTML controller requests, you will only load the HTML and you will not reload JavaScript and stylesheets.
This definitely can make an app perform better, even if the JavaScript and stylesheets are cached by the browser, as they will still require parsing.

## Requirements for Using Turbolinks

1. Either **avoid using [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)** or be prepared to deal with any conflicts between it and Turbolinks.
2. **Use one JS and one CSS file** throughout your app. Otherwise, you will have to figure out how best to handle multiple JS and CSS files throughout the app given Turbolinks.

## Why Not Turbolinks

1. [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) handles the back and forward buttons, as does Turbolinks. You _might_ be able to make this work. _Please share your findings._
1. You want to do code splitting to minimize the JavaScript loaded.

## More Information

- CSRF tokens need thorough checking with Turbolinks5. Turbolinks5 changes the head element by JavaScript (not only body) on page changes with the correct csrf meta tag. But if the JS code parsed this from head when several windows were opened, then our specs didn't all pass. I didn't examine the details, it may be caused by app code, not library code. Anyway, it may need additional checking because there is a CSRF helper in ReactOnRails and it needs to work with Turbolinks5.
- Turbolinks5 sends requests without the `Accept: */*` in the header, only exactly like `Accept: text/html` which makes Rails behave a bit specifically compared to normal and mime-parsing, which is skipped when Rails sees `*/*`. For more details on the special handling of `*/*` you can read [Mime Type Resolution in Rails](http://blog.bigbinary.com/2010/11/23/mime-type-resolution-in-rails.html).
- If you're using multiple Webpack bundles, make sure that there are no name conflicts between JS objects or Redux store paths.

### Install Checklist

1. Include turbolinks via yarn as shown in the [react-webpack-rails-tutorial](https://github.com/shakacode/react-webpack-rails-tutorial/blob/8a6c8aa2e3b7ae5b08b0a9744fb3a63a2fe0f002/client/webpack.client.base.config.js#L22) or include the gem "turbolinks".
1. Included the proper "track" tags when you include the javascript and stylesheet:

```erb
  <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'application', media: 'all', 'data-turbolinks-track' => 'reload' %>
  <%= javascript_include_tag 'application', 'data-turbolinks-track' => 'reload' %>
```

NOTE: for Turbolinks 2.x, use `'data-turbolinks-track' => true`

1. Add turbolinks to your `application.js` file:
   ```javascript
   //= require turbolinks
   ```

## Turbolinks 5

Turbolinks 5 is now supported. React on Rails will automatically detect which version of Turbolinks you are using and use the correct event handlers.

For more information on Turbolinks 5: [https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks](https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks)

## Turbolinks from NPM

See the [instructions on installing from NPM](https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks#installation-using-npm).

```js
import Turbolinks from 'turbolinks';
Turbolinks.start();
```

### Async script loading

Async script loading can be done like this (starting with Shakapacker 8.2):

```erb
  <%= javascript_include_tag 'application', async: Rails.env.production? %>
```

If you use `document.addEventListener("turbolinks:load", function() {...});` somewhere in your code, you will notice that Turbolinks 5 does not fire `turbolinks:load` on initial page load. A quick workaround for React on Rails earlier than 15 is to use `defer` instead of `async`:

```erb
  <%= javascript_include_tag 'application', defer: Rails.env.production? %>
```

More information on this issue can be found here: https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks/issues/28

When loading your scripts asynchronously your components may not be registered correctly. Call `ReactOnRails.reactOnRailsPageLoaded()` to re-initialize like so:

```js
document.addEventListener('turbolinks:load', function () {
  ReactOnRails.reactOnRailsPageLoaded();
});
```

React on Rails 15 fixes both issues, so if you still have the listener it can be removed (and should be as `reactOnRailsPageLoaded()` is now async).

> [!WARNING]
> Do not use `force_load: false` with Turbolinks if you have async scripts.

## Troubleshooting

To turn on tracing of Turbolinks events, put this in your registration file, where you register your components.

```js
ReactOnRails.setOptions({
  traceTurbolinks: true,
  turbo: true,
});
```

Rather than setting the value to true, you could set it to TRACE_TURBOLINKS, and then you could place this in your `webpack.client.base.config.js`:

Define this const at the top of the file:

```js
const devBuild = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production';
```

Add this DefinePlugin option:

```js
  plugins: [
   new webpack.DefinePlugin({
     TRACE_TURBOLINKS: devBuild,
   }),
```

At Webpack compile time, the value of devBuild is inserted into your file.

Once you do that, you'll see messages prefixed with **TURBO:** like this in the browser console:

Turbolinks Classic:

```text
TURBO: WITH TURBOLINKS: document page:before-unload and page:change handlers installed. (program)
TURBO: reactOnRailsPageLoaded
```

Turbolinks 5:

```text
TURBO: WITH TURBOLINKS 5: document turbolinks:before-render and turbolinks:render handlers installed. (program)
TURBO: reactOnRailsPageLoaded
```

We've noticed that Turbolinks doesn't work if you use the RubyGem versions of jQuery and jQuery ujs. Therefore, we recommend using the JS packages instead. See the [tutorial app](https://github.com/shakacode/react-webpack-rails-tutorial) for how to accomplish this.
