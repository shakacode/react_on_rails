## In your engine

+ At the top of `config/initializers/react_on_rails.rb`
```ruby
ActiveSupport.on_load(:action_view) do
  include ReactOnRailsHelper
end
```
+ In your `<engine_name>.gemspec`:
```ruby
s.add_dependency 'react_on_rails', '~> 6'
```
+ In your `lib/<engine_name>.rb` (the entry point for your engine)
```ruby
require "react_on_rails"
```
## In the project including your engine

Place `gem 'react_on_rails', '~> 6'` before the gem pointing at your engine in your gemfile.

Requiring `react_on_rails` and including the helper will get rid of any issues where react on rails or react_component is undefined.

As far as solving the assets issue, `lib/tasks/assets.rake` in `react_on_rails` would somehow have to know that `react_on_rails` was included in an engine, and decide the path accordingly. This might be impossible, especially in the case of multiple engines using `react_on_rails` in a single application.

Another solution would be to detach this rake task from the `rails assets:precompile` task. This can be done by adding `REACT_ON_RAILS_PRECOMPILE=false` to your environment. If you do so, then react assets will have to be bundled separately from `rails assets:precompile`.
