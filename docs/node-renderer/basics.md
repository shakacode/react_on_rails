# Requirements
* You must use React on Rails v11.0.7 or higher.

# Install the Gem and the Node Module
See [Installation](https://www.shakacode.com/react-on-rails-pro/docs/installation/).

# Setup Node Renderer Server
**node-renderer** is a standalone Node application to serve React SSR requests from a **Rails** client. You don't need any **Ruby** code to setup and launch it. You can configure with the command line or with a launch file.

## Simple Command Line for node-renderer

1. ENV values for the default config are (See [JS Configuration](https://www.shakacode.com/react-on-rails-pro/docs/node-renderer/js-configuration/) for more details):
    * `RENDERER_PORT`
    * `RENDERER_LOG_LEVEL`
    * `RENDERER_BUNDLE_PATH`
    * `RENDERER_WORKERS_COUNT`
    * `RENDERER_PASSWORD`
    * `RENDERER_ALL_WORKERS_RESTART_INTERVAL`
    * `RENDERER_DELAY_BETWEEN_INDIVIDUAL_WORKER_RESTARTS`
    * `RENDERER_SUPPORT_MODULES`
2. Configure ENV values and run the command. Note, you can set port with args `-p <PORT>`. For example, assuming node-renderer is in your path:
   ```
   RENDERER_BUNDLE_PATH=/app/.node-renderer-bundles node-renderer
   ```
3. You can use a command line argument of `-p SOME_PORT` to override any ENV value for the PORT.

## JavaScript Configuration File
For the most control over the setup, create a JavaScript file to start the NodeRenderer.

1. Create some project directory, let's say `renderer-app`:
   ```sh
   mkdir renderer-app
   cd renderer-app
   ```
2. Make sure you have **Node.js** version **14** or higher and **Yarn** installed.
3. Init node application and yarn add to install `@shakacode-tools/react-on-rails-pro-node-renderer` package.
   ```sh
   yarn init
   yarn add https://[your-github-token]:x-oauth-basic@github.com/shakacode/react_on_rails_pro.git\#master
   ```
4. Configure a JavaScript file that will launch the rendering server per the docs in [Node Renderer JavaScript Configuration](https://www.shakacode.com/react-on-rails-pro/docs/node-renderer/js-configuration/). For example, create a file `node-renderer.js`. Here is a simple example that uses all the defaults except for bundlePath:

   ```javascript
   import path from 'path';
   import reactOnRailsProNodeRenderer from '@shakacode-tools/react-on-rails-pro-node-renderer';

   const config = {
     bundlePath: path.resolve(__dirname, '../.node-renderer-bundles'),
   };

   reactOnRailsProNodeRenderer(config);
   ```
5. Now you can launch your renderer server with `node node-renderer.js`. You will probably add a script to your `package.json`.
6. You can use a command line argument of `-p SOME_PORT` to override any configured or ENV value for the port.

# Setup Rails Application
Create `config/initializers/react_on_rails_pro.rb` and configure the **renderer server**. See configuration values in [Configuration](https://www.shakacode.com/react-on-rails-pro/docs/configuration/). Pay attention to:

1. Set `config.server_renderer = "NodeRenderer"`
2. Leave the default of `config.prerender_caching = true` and ensure your Rails cache is properly configured to handle the additional cache load.
3. Configure values beginning with `renderer_`
4. Use ENV values for values like `renderer_url` so that your deployed server is properly configured. If the ENV value is unset, the default for the renderer_url is `localhost:3800`.
5. Here's a tiny example using mostly defaults:
```ruby
ReactOnRailsPro.configure do |config|
 config.server_renderer = "NodeRenderer"
 
 # when this ENV value is not defined, the local server at localhost:3800 is used 
 config.renderer_url = ENV["REACT_RENDERER_URL"] 
end
```

## Troublshooting

* See [JS Memory Leaks](https://www.shakacode.com/react-on-rails-pro/docs/js-memory-leaks/).
  
## Upgrading

The NodeRenderer has a protocol version on both the Rails and Node sides. If the Rails server sends a protocol version that does not match the Node side, an error is returned. Ideally, you want to keep both the Rails and Node sides at the same version.
