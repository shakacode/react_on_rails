1. Install these 2 packages: `@sentry/node` and `@sentry/tracing`.

### Sentry Tracing
To use this feature, you need to add `config.sentryTracing = true` (or ENV `SENTRY_TRACING=true`)
and optionally the `config.sentryTracesSampleRate = 0.1` (or ENV `SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE=0.1`).
The value of the sample rate is the percentage of requests to trace. The default
**config.sentryTracesSampleRate** is **0.1**, meaning 10% of requests are traced.

For documentation of Sentry Tracing, see the
