# React on Rails Pro: Introducing React Server Components & SSR Streaming

**Subject: ðŸš€ Revolutionary Performance Boost: React Server Components & SSR Streaming Now Available in React on Rails Pro**

---

June 24, 2025

We're thrilled to announce a major update: [React on Rails Pro](https://www.shakacode.com/react-on-rails-pro/) now supports **React Server Components** and **Serverâ€‘Side Rendering (SSR) Streaming**. These features have driven significant performance gains in realâ€‘world applicationsâ€”hereâ€™s how they can transform yours.

## ðŸŽ¯ What This Means for Your Applications

- **Faster load times**
- **Smaller JavaScript bundles**
- **Better Core Web Vitals**
- **Improved SEO**
- **Smoother user interactions**

## ðŸ”¥ React Server Components

Server Components execute on the server and stream HTML to the clientâ€”no server-side JavaScript in your bundle. Realâ€‘world results include:

- [productonboarding.com experiment](https://frigade.com/blog/bundle-size-reduction-with-rsc-and-frigade):
  - **62% reduction** in clientâ€‘side bundle size
  - **63% improvement** in Google Speed Index
  - Total blocking time: **from 110â€¯ms to 1â€¯ms**
- [geekyants.com Case Study](https://geekyants.com/en-gb/blog/boosting-performance-with-nextjs-and-react-server-components-a-geekyantscom-case-study):
  - **52% smaller** JavaScript and TypeScript codebase
  - Lighthouse scores improved **from \~50 to \~90**
- [Airbnbâ€™s RSC migration results](<https://questlab.pro/blog-posts/web-development/wd-pl-2024-articleId912i1h212818#:~:text=%22Our%20migration%20to%20React%20Server%20Components%20resulted%20in%20a%2015%25%20improvement%20in%20core%20web%20vitals%20and%20a%2023%25%20reduction%20in%20Time%20to%20First%20Byte%20(TTFB)%20across%20all%20markets.%22%20%2D%20Airbnb%20Engineering%20Team>):
- **15% improvement** in core web vitals
- **23% reduction** in Time to First Byte
- [Metaâ€™s developer portal migration](https://questlab.pro/blog-posts/web-development/wd-pl-2024-articleId912i1h212818#:~:text=Meta%27s%20RSC%20Implementation%20Results):
  - **30% reduction** in JavaScript bundle size
  - **60% improvement** in Time to Interactive
  - **45% faster** First Contentful Paint
  - **50% reduction** in server response time
  - **25% decrease** in overall maintenance complexity

Please note that only the first of these directly compares performance of equivalent applications with and without React Server Components.
Other migrations may include React or other dependency upgrades and so on.

## ðŸŒŠ SSR Streaming

SSR Streaming sends HTML to the browser in chunks as itâ€™s generated, enabling progressive rendering:

  - **32% faster** time to first byte
  - **40% faster** total blocking time
  - Negative result: **2% increase** in server load
- [Hulu case study](https://www.compilenrun.com/docs/framework/nextjs/nextjs-ecosystem/nextjs-case-studies/#case-study-3-hulus-streaming-platform):
  - **30% faster** page load times
