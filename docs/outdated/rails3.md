# Rails 3

* Please let us know if you find any issues with Rails 3.
* Rails 3 is confirmed to work up with versions up to 6.8.x.

## Known Issues

1. If you do not skip bootstrap for the generator, you cannot generate a working app, as bootstrap-sass does not support Rails 3, or at least the version we're using.
