# React on Rails Monorepo Merger Plan Reference

The complete React on Rails Monorepo Merger Plan is located at:

**[docs/MONOREPO_MERGER_PLAN.md](./MONOREPO_MERGER_PLAN.md)**

This plan outlines the 7-phase implementation for merging the `react_on_rails` and `react_on_rails_pro` repositories into a unified monorepo while maintaining:

- Separate package identities (2 Ruby gems + 3 NPM packages)
- Proper license compliance (MIT vs Pro)
- Complete git history preservation
- CI integrity at every step

**Status:** Phase 1 - License Cleanup & Documentation (In Progress)

For implementation details, progress tracking, and specific tasks, refer to the main plan document.
