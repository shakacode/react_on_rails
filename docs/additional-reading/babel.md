# Babel

As of React on Rails 2.0, we recommend Babel 6 and at least node version 5.5. If you want to stick with Babel 5 for a bit, see [Issue #238](https://github.com/shakacode/react_on_rails/issues/238).

We recommend that you take a look at https://github.com/shakacode/react-webpack-rails-tutorial and follow the recipe there. We will try to keep that simple example updated.
