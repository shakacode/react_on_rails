 *  React will see that the state is the same and not do anything.
 *  Note, this is imported as "HelloWorldApp" by "clientRegistration.jsx"
 *
 *  Note, this is a fictional example, as you'd only use a generator function if you wanted to run
 *  some extra code, such as setting up Redux and React-Router.
