# Service Dependencies Configuration
#
# This file defines external services that must be running before bin/dev starts.
# Copy this file to .dev-services.yml and customize for your application.
#
# bin/dev will check each service before starting the development server.
# If any service is not running, it will display helpful error messages with
# instructions on how to start the service.
#
# For the React on Rails dummy app, we typically don't require external services,
# but here are some common examples you might use in a real application:

services:
  # Uncomment if your app uses Redis for caching or background jobs:
  # redis:
  #   check_command: "redis-cli ping"
  #   expected_output: "PONG"
  #   start_command: "redis-server"
  #   install_hint: "brew install redis (macOS) or apt-get install redis-server (Linux)"
  #   description: "Redis (for caching and background jobs)"

  # Uncomment if your app uses PostgreSQL:
  # postgresql:
  #   check_command: "pg_isready"
  #   expected_output: "accepting connections"
  #   start_command: "pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start"
  #   install_hint: "brew install postgresql (macOS) or apt-get install postgresql (Linux)"
  #   description: "PostgreSQL database"

  # Uncomment if your app uses Elasticsearch:
  # elasticsearch:
  #   check_command: "curl -s http://localhost:9200"
  #   expected_output: "cluster_name"
  #   start_command: "brew services start elasticsearch-full"
  #   install_hint: "brew install elasticsearch-full"
  #   description: "Elasticsearch (for search)"
