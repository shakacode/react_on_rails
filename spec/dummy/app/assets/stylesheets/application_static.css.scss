// These assets are located in app/assets/webpack directory, and are generated ONLY when static
// assets are prepared (not for hot reloading assets).

// Super important: This file is loaded even for hot loading only, so we need to be sure
// that we don't reference the static generated CSS files.

// If we were importing bootstrap, we'd have this generated.

// Non-webpack assets
