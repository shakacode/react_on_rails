== Description

The mime-types library provides a library and registry for information about
MIME content type definitions. It can be used to determine defined filename
extensions for MIME types, or to use filename extensions to look up the likely
MIME type definitions.

This is release 2.99, the deprecation version of mime-types 2.x, where
deprecation warnings are noisy and data that has been deprecated is now no
longer available. The data is both dropped from the data files and is stubbed
out as empty or +nil+ values as appropriate.

mime-types-2.6 was the last version of mime-types 2.x with newly available
features, and mime-types 2.99 will only receive quarterly updates to the IANA
registered MIME media types plus any security updates that may be required.

If the loss of the deprecated data matters, be sure to set your dependency
appropriately:

   gem 'mime-types', '~> 2.6, < 2.99'

=== About MIME Media Types

MIME content types are used in MIME-compliant communications, as in e-mail or
HTTP traffic, to indicate the type of content which is transmitted. The
mime-types library provides the ability for detailed information about MIME
entities (provided as an enumerable collection of MIME::Type objects) to be
determined and used. There are many types defined by RFCs and vendors, so the
list is long but by definition incomplete; don't hesitate to add additional
type definitions. MIME type definitions found in mime-types are from RFCs, W3C
recommendations, the {IANA Media Types
registry}[https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml], and
user contributions. It conforms to RFCs 2045 and 2231.

=== mime-types 1.x End of Life

mime-types 1.x has reached end of life and is no longer supported as of
2015-10-27 and will receive no updates at all.

=== mime-types 2.x End of Life

mime-types 2.x is supported as 2.99.x receiving quarterly updates of the IANA
registry and security updates for two years. It will reach full end of life on
2017-11-21.

=== mime-types 3.x

Users are encouraged to upgrade to mime-types 3.x as soon as is practical.
mime-types 3.x requires Ruby 2.0 compatibility and a simpler licensing scheme.

== Synopsis

MIME types are used in MIME entities, as in email or HTTP traffic. It is useful
at times to have information available about MIME types (or, inversely, about
files). A MIME::Type stores the known information about one MIME type.

   require 'mime/types'

   plaintext = MIME::Types['text/plain'] # => [ text/plain ]
   text = plaintext.first
   puts text.media_type            # => 'text'
   puts text.sub_type              # => 'plain'

   puts text.extensions.join(' ')  # => 'txt asc c cc h hh cpp hpp dat hlp'
   puts text.preferred_extension   # => 'txt'
   puts text.friendly              # => 'Text Document'
   puts text.i18n_key              # => 'text.plain'

   puts text.encoding              # => quoted-printable
   puts text.default_encoding      # => quoted-printable
   puts text.binary?               # => false
   puts text.ascii?                # => true
   puts text.obsolete?             # => false
   puts text.registered?           # => true
   puts text.complete?             # => true

   puts text                       # => 'text/plain'

   puts text == 'text/plain'       # => true
   puts 'text/plain' == text       # => true
   puts text == 'text/x-plain'     # => false
   puts 'text/x-plain' == text     # => false

   puts MIME::Type.simplified('x-appl/x-zip') # => 'appl/zip'
   puts MIME::Type.i18n_key('x-appl/x-zip') # => 'appl.zip'

   puts text.like?('text/x-plain') # => true
   puts text.like?(MIME::Type.new('x-text/x-plain')) # => true

   puts text.xrefs.inspect # => { "rfc" => [ "rfc2046", "rfc3676", "rfc5147" ] }
   puts text.xref_urls # => [ "http://www.iana.org/go/rfc2046",
                       #      "http://www.iana.org/go/rfc3676",
                       #      "http://www.iana.org/go/rfc5147" ]

   xtext = MIME::Type.new('x-text/x-plain')
   puts xtext.media_type # => 'text'
   puts xtext.raw_media_type # => 'x-text'
   puts xtext.sub_type # => 'plain'
   puts xtext.raw_sub_type # => 'x-plain'
   puts xtext.complete? # => false

   puts MIME::Types.any? { |type| type.content_type == 'text/plain' } # => true
   puts MIME::Types.all?(&:registered?) # => false

   # Various string representations of MIME types
   qcelp = MIME::Types['audio/QCELP'].first # => audio/QCELP
   puts qcelp.content_type         # => 'audio/QCELP'
   puts qcelp.simplified           # => 'audio/qcelp'

   xwingz = MIME::Types['application/x-Wingz'].first # => application/x-Wingz
   puts xwingz.content_type        # => 'application/x-Wingz'
   puts xwingz.simplified          # => 'application/wingz'

=== Columnar Store

mime-types 2.6 introduced an experimental columnar storage format that reduces
the default memory footprint. It does this by selectively loading data. When a
registry is first loaded from a columnar store, only the canonical MIME type
and registered extensions will be loaded and the MIME type will be connected to
its registry. When extended data is required (including +registered+,
+obsolete+, and +use_instead+), that data is loaded from its own column file
for all types in the registry. This load is done with a Mutex to ensure that
the types are updated safely in a multithreaded environment.

Columnar storage is slated to become the default storage format for mime-types
3.0, but until that is released, the default is still to use the JSON storage
format. As such, columnar storage can only currently be loaded at an
application level with the following specification in the application Gemfile:

   gem 'mime-types', require: 'mime/types/columnar'

Projects that do not use Bundler, and libraries that wish to suggest this
behaviour to applications are encouraged to require this directly, but only if
you specify a dependency on mime-types 2.6.

   require 'mime/types/columnar'

Although this require will not be necessary after mime-types 3, it will work
through at least {version
4}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/pull/96#issuecomment-100725400]
and possibly beyond.

Note that the new Columnar class (MIME::Type::Columnar) and module
(MIME::Types::Columnar) are considered private variant implementations of
MIME::Type and MIME::Types and the specific implementation should not be relied
upon by consumers of the mime-types library. Instead, depend on the public
implementations only.

=== Cached Storage

Since version 2.0, mime-types has supported a cache of MIME types based on
<tt>Marshal.dump</tt>. The cache is invalidated for each released version of
mime-types so that version 2.5 is not reused for version 2.6. If the
environment variable +RUBY_MIME_TYPES_CACHE+ is set to a cache file, mime-types
will attempt to load the MIME type registry from the cache file. If it cannot,
it will load the types normally and then saves the registry to the cache file.

The current mime-types cache is not compatible with the columnar storage
format. This will be resolved for mime-types 3.

== mime-types Modified Semantic Versioning

The mime-types library has one version number, but this single version number
tracks both API changes and registry data changes; this is not wholly
compatible with all aspects of {Semantic Versioning}[http://semver.org/];
removing a MIME type from the registry *could* be considered a breaking change
under some interpretations of semantic versioning (as lookups for that
particular type would no longer work by default).

mime-types uses a modified semantic versioning scheme. Given the version
MAJOR.MINOR:

1. If an incompatible API (code) change is made, the MAJOR version will be
   incremented, MINOR will be set to zero, and PATCH will be reset to the
   implied zero.

2. If an API (code) feature is added that does not break compatibilty OR if
   there are MIME types added, removed, or changed in the registry, the MINOR
   version will be incremented and PATCH will be reset to the implied zero.

3. If there is a bugfix to a feature added in the most recent MAJOR.MINOR
   release, OR if purely typographical errors are fixed in MIME types, the
   implied PATCH value will be incremented resulting in MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.

In practical terms, there should be a MINOR release roughly monthly to track
updated or changed MIME types from the official IANA registry. This does not
indicate when new API features have been added, but all minor versions of
mime-types 2.x will be backwards compatible; the interfaces marked deprecated
will be removed in mime-types 3.x.
