2015-06-23 - 1.3.2 * Fix release 1.3.1
2014-06-17 - 1.3.1 * This release was a bit premature, yanked it.
2014-02-06 - 1.3.0 * Support bright and faint color names.
2013-05-30 - 1.2.2 * No more fun and smileys, now you have to call term_display
                     yourself.
                   * term_display can now display image URLs directly.
2013-05-25 - 1.2.1 * Merge patch from Gavin Kistner <gavin@phrogz.net> to
                     prevent warnings when running in -w mode.
2013-05-16 - 1.2.0 * Add term_mandel and term_display executables.
                   * Implement configurable color metrics.
                   * Add gradient functionality for color attributes.
2013-04-18 - 1.1.5 * Add colortab executable to rubygem binary config
2013-03-26 - 1.1.4 * Easier access to color attributes via color(123) or
                     approximate html colors like color('#336caf').
2013-03-26 - 1.1.3 * Fix a bug where respond_to could overflow the stack.
2013-03-25 - 1.1.2 * Change the API: color0 - color255 to color(:color0) -
                     color(:color255), and on_color0 to on_color(:color0) -
                     on_color(:color255); the previous way caused some
                     failures, sorry. On the plus side you can now do
                     color('#4a6ab4') and get the nearest terminal color to
                     this html color.

                     related HTML colors.

                     methods.
