# - Only security updates (version updates disabled via open-pull-requests-limit: 0)
# - Dependencies grouped within each ecosystem/directory
# - 3-day minimum release age for new versions (so they can't be unpublished in NPM)
# - Labels: "dependencies" (default), language-specific (javascript/ruby/github-actions), "full-ci"
#
# Note: Root pnpm workspace (/) covers packages/react-on-rails, etc.
# Dummy apps have separate lock files and are listed explicitly.
