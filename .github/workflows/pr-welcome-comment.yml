            ### 🚀 Running Full CI Suite

            By default, PRs run a subset of CI jobs for faster feedback (latest Ruby/Node versions only).

            To run the **complete CI suite** including all dependency combinations and skipped jobs, comment:

            ```
            /run-full-ci
            ```

            This will trigger:
            - ✅ Minimum supported versions (Ruby 3.2, Node 20)
            - ✅ All example app tests
            - ✅ Pro package integration tests
            - ✅ All test matrices

            The full CI suite takes longer but ensures compatibility across all supported versions before merging.
